14128723,java,I used to see both Building and Cleaning actions in their own separate windows where I could wait for them to complete before continuing. Several weeks ago I must have clicked Run in Background  because now the progress only appears in a small obscured Progress view.  How do I set the progress of things like Java Build and Clean to appear in a popup dialog again? 
593205,c#,I see this line in many online examples of using the Action delegate: public event Action MyEvent;  But when I try it in my own code I get this error  Using the generic type 'System.Action' requires '1' type arguments  The documentation certainly describes a form of Action without any type parameter. What am I missing?
377901,java,I'm implementing a JAX-WS webservice that will be consumed by external Java and PHP clients. The clients have to authenticate with a username and password stored in a database per client. What authentication mechanism is best to use to make sure that misc clients can use it?
638886,java|html,A well known problem with Java Applets in webpages is that browsers ignore the z-index of the applet tag vs. other components in the page. No matter how you position and z-index elements in the page applets will draw themselves on top of everything. There is a workaround known as the iframe shim as described here: http://www.oratransplant.nl/2007/10/26/using-iframe-shim-to-partly-cover-a-java-applet/. However this workaround does not work in Safari 3 or 4 in Windows (assuming the same for Mac). Does anyone know a way to make it work in Safari?  Does anyone have ideas about how to pressure Sun to fix the underlying problem so we can avoid clumsy shims? Here is a bug report on the issue http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6646289 notice that it has been open for a year however other bug reports go back many many years. This is so frustrating don't Sun understand that this is the very sort of thing that has marginalized Java as a way of doing cool stuff in the browser? I love you Java but you are not helping your situation...
235982,javascript,The most favorite feature of StackOverflow for me is that it can automatically detect code in post and set appropriate color to the code. I'm wondering how the color is set. When I do a Ctrl+F5 on a page the code seems first be black text then change to be colorful. Is it done by jQuery?
520030,c#,I want to get the distinct values in a list but not by the standard equality comparison. What I want to do is something like this: return myList.Distinct( (x y) => x.Url == y.Url );  I can't there's no extension method in Linq that will do this - just one that takes an IEqualityComparer. I can hack around it with this: return myList.GroupBy( x => x.Url ).Select( g => g.First() );  But that seems messy. It also doesn't quite do the same thing - I can only use it here because I have a single key. I could also add my own: public static IEnumerable<T> Distinct<T>( this IEnumerable<T> input Func<TTbool> compare ) { //write my own here }  But that does seem rather like writing something that should be there in the first place. Anyone know why this method isn't there? Am I missing something?
15301999,python,In Python 2.x (I use 2.7) which is the proper way to use default arguments with *args and **kwargs? I've found a question on SO related to this topic but that is for Python 3: Calling a Python function with *args**kwargs and optional / default arguments There they say this method works: def func(arg1 arg2 *args opt_arg='def_val' **kwargs): #...  In 2.7 it results in a SyntaxError. Is there any recommended way to define such a function? I got it working this way but I'd guess there is a nicer solution. def func(arg1 arg2 *args **kwargs): opt_arg ='def_val' if kwargs.__contains__('opt_arg'): opt_arg = kwargs['opt_arg'] #... 
216694,c#,So i am reorganizing a winforms C# solution to help decouple and make it cleaner and more organized. The solution tracks a small business ordersetc . . I have broken out the projects so far into App.View - all GUI Related Code App.Data - just data structures and interfaces. No other implementation code App.BusinessLogic - all business logic code that has no GUI references I have some classes that i can't figure out where they belong. Please let me know your thoughts which project each class should go or if there is another project that should get created for this.  A Class that retrieves user preferences from a database A Class that retrieves static data from our static data server and returns sets of data results. A Class that brings down user entitlements A model class that stores a hashtable of orders A class that emails out messages on a user action

586829,c#,I have a large DataGridView control that has several cells most of which contain a button. How can I change the color of those buttons? This changes the outline of the button but not the button itself. row.Cells[2].Style.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;  This doesn't seem to change anything that's visible: row.Cells[2].Style.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;  If it's not possible to change the background is it possible to change the font on the button? Using .NET 2.0.

490618,php|javascript|jquery|html,I have about 7 Javascript files now (thanks to various jQuery plugins) and 4-5 CSS files. I'm curious as to what's the best practice for dealing with these including where in the document they should be loaded? YSlow tells me that Javascript files should be--where possible--included at the end. The end of the body? It mentions that the delimeter seems to be whether they write content. All my Javascript files are functions and jQuery code (all done when ready()) so that should be OK. So should I include one CSS and one Javascript file and have those include the rest? Should I concatenate all my files into one? Should I put Javascript my tags at the very end of my document? Edit: FWIW yes this is PHP.

Does anyone have any ideas as to where I am going wrong? Thanks Alex

165404,c#,I'm looking for some good references for learning how to model 2d physics in games. I am not looking for a library to do it for me - I want to think and learn not blindly use someone else's work. I've done a good bit of Googling and while I've found a few tutorials on GameDev etc. I find their tutorials hard to understand because they are either written poorly or assume a level of mathematical understanding that I don't yet possess. For specifics - I'm looking for how to model a top-down 2d game sort of like a tank combat game - and I want to accurately model (among other things) acceleration and speed heat buildup of 'components' collisions between models and level boundaries and missile-type weapons. Websites recommended books blogs code examples - all are welcome if they will aid understanding. I'm considering using C# and F# to build my game so code examples in either of those languages would be great - but don't let language stop you from posting a good link. =) Edit: I don't mean that I don't understand math - it's more the case that I don't know what I need to know in order to understand the systems involved and don't really know how to find the resources that will teach me in an understandable way.

714108,java,Do you know some neat Java libaries that allow you to make cartesian product of two (or more) sets?  For example: I have three sets. One with objects of class Person second with objects of class Gift and third with objects of class GiftExtension. I want to generate one set containing all possible triples Person-Gift-GiftExtension. The number of sets might vary so I cannot do this in nested foreach loop. Under some conditions my application needs to make a product of Person-Gift pair sometimes it is triple Person-Gift-GiftExtension sometimes there might even be sets Person-Gift-GiftExtension-GiftSecondExtension-GiftThirdExtension etc.

221732,c#,I've been searching a lot but couldn't find a solution. How do you deal with a DateTime that should be able to contain an uninitialized value (equivalent to null)? I have a class which might have a DateTime property value set or not. I was thinking of initializing the property holder to DateTime.MinValue which then could easily be checked. I guess this is a quite common question how do you do that?
180401,c++,I've recently decided that I just have to finally learn C/C++ and there is one thing I do not really understand about pointers or more precisely their definition. How about these examples:  int* test; int *test; int * test; int* testtest2; int *testtest2; int * testtest2;  Now to my understanding the first three cases are all doing the same: Test is not an int but a pointer to one. The second set of examples is a bit more tricky. In case 4 both test and test2 will be pointers to an int whereas in case 5 only test is a pointer whereas test2 is a real int. What about case 6? Same as case 5?

689959,c++,I'm writing a game and I'm wound up in needing a console for simple text input; filenames and simple values.  Using SDL my console looks the following at it's simplest: class Console { public: typedef std::list<String> InputList; enum Result { NOTHING = 0 ENTERED ESCAPED }; static const String& GetInput() { return input; } static Result Query(SDLKey lastKey) { if(lastResult == ENTERED || lastResult == ESCAPED) { input.clear(); } switch (lastKey) { case SDLK_a: case SDLK_b: case SDLK_c: case SDLK_d: case SDLK_e: case SDLK_f: case SDLK_g: case SDLK_h: case SDLK_i: case SDLK_j: case SDLK_k: case SDLK_l: case SDLK_m: case SDLK_n: case SDLK_o: case SDLK_p: case SDLK_q: case SDLK_r: case SDLK_s: case SDLK_t: case SDLK_u: case SDLK_v: case SDLK_w: case SDLK_x: case SDLK_y: case SDLK_z: case SDLK_0: case SDLK_1: case SDLK_2: case SDLK_3: case SDLK_4: case SDLK_5: case SDLK_6: case SDLK_7: case SDLK_8: case SDLK_9: case SDLK_SLASH: case SDLK_BACKSLASH: case SDLK_PERIOD: case SDLK_COMMA: case SDLK_SPACE: case SDLK_UNDERSCORE: case SDLK_MINUS: input += static_cast<char> (lastKey); lastResult = NOTHING; break; case SDLK_RETURN: lastResult = ENTERED; break; case SDLK_ESCAPE: lastResult = ESCAPED; break; } return lastResult; } protected: static Result lastResult; static String input; };  This would be called from the application's main event loop if the console is active and the last event was a keypress then the result of the input is processed at a state where it's necessary. Of course it looks incredibly awkward... What's a better way to implement a simple console that can be easily rendered in my game's window? (Not going anywhere near to highly unportable solutions like having to reroute std::cout or writing code to bring up a UNIX console etc.)

36275043,javascript,If a number when divided by two has a remainder that is not equal to 0 this number must be odd. I'm trying to use that logic in my if statement to keep only odd values and get rid of even ones. I'm not sure how I'm doing this wrong but myArray is returning even values as well as odd. Any ideas?  function sumFibs(num) { var myArray = [11]; // Create fibonacci sequence // Stop creating fibonacci numbers at num // Push odd numbers to oddNums array for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) { if (myArray[i+1] + myArray[i] <= num && myArray[i+1] + myArray[i] % 2 !== 0) { myArray.push(myArray[i+1] + myArray[i]); } } // End loop. console.log(myArray); // Summation of oddNums array. return myArray.reduce(function(ab) { return a + b; }); } // End function. sumFibs(1000); 
13792855,php,I'm writing a singleton wrapper for database calls in my site. When catching exceptions from PDO should I terminate the script or treat them as warnings? Is there a way to determine the severity of an exception thrown by PDO? For example is there an equivalent of PHP's notices?
12804074,javascript,i'm a bit confused about the reason it does not work in Firefox when it works in other(all) browsers. Initializing EventSource and registering a listener: var output = new EventSource('/subscribe'); output.addEventListener('shell_stream' function(e) { $('#shell-output').append(e.data + <br/> ); } false);  Then on page loading i'm looking through query string and if there is a file and the run action i'm sending them to server(via ajax) and the server sending back the data to the listener registered above. Debugged the script a lot. It does send request and receive valid response and server for sure sending data to listener. However on Firefox the listener does not react in any way. Worth to note what the listener works perfect if the user click Run button which calls exactly the same function which is called on page load if file and run found in query string. Also if I fire an alert() on page load and user click it the listener will work! Here is the live link to try in various browsers: http://cibox.org/slivu/stackoverflow?file=extract-image.rb&run=true Thank you.
24349258,android,I have been stacked for hours trying to solve that problem. I will explain my code structure. I have two classes TwitterActivity (the main activity) and SearchTwitter. InTwitterActivity I sign in and then start the SearchTwitter activity. I have also their xml layout files activity_twitter.xml and search.xml. The classes look like: public class TwitterActivity extends Activity { private Button mSignin; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_twitter); mSignin = (Button)findViewById(R.id.login_id); mSignin.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { //startSiginingProcess(...) Intent intent = new Intent(TwitterActivity.this SearchTwitter.class); startActivity(intent); } } }); }  The activity_twitter.xml has just a single button Sign In button. The SearchTwitter activity looks like: public class SearchTwitter extends ListActivity { private Button buttonLogout; public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){ super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.search); initializeComponent(); initControl(); /********************************************************/ ArrayList<String> events = new ArrayList<String>(); events.add( Item1 ); events.add( Item2 ); ListView ls = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.list); ls.setAdapter(new ArrayAdapter<String> (this R.layout.search events)); /********************************************************/ } private void initControl() { //Finish Signing procces } private void initializeComponent(){ buttonLogout = (Button) findViewById(R.id.buttonLogout); buttonLogout.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){ @Override public void onClick(View v) { //Just LogOut }); }  And search.xml is: <?xml version= 1.0 encoding= utf-8 ?> <RelativeLayout xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android android:orientation= vertical android:layout_width= match_parent android:layout_height= match_parent android:background= #2175B0 > <Button android:id= @+id/buttonLogout android:layout_width= wrap_content android:layout_height= wrap_content android:layout_alignParentRight= true android:layout_alignParentTop= true android:text= @string/logout /> <ListView android:id = @android:id/list android:layout_width= wrap_content android:layout_height= wrap_content android:layout_below= @+id/buttonLogout /> <TextView android:id= @android:id/text1 android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= wrap_content /> </RelativeLayout>  WHAT IS MY PROBLEM NOW  In the SearchTwitter activity I did extend ListActivity All I want to do is to make the code surrounded by stars in SearchTwitter work. I have tried lots of ways but No result. My app always crashed.  I feel exhausted I don't know what to do anymore. Feel free to ask any question. Any kind of help suggestion is highly appreciated. Thanks. PS: The code surrounded by stars is wrong.

31637423,php,I am getting this error:  Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 43148176 bytes)  What I am trying to do is on my home page there is popup login form where users login and gets into a 'site/members_area'page. But something very bad is happening with me here after filling up the form when I click on login button. I am getting these errors: firstly maximum execution time limit after correcting that I get above error increased the memory limit which is not good practice for good coding. And even my code doesn't need that much memory - where am I going wrong? In last after spending huge amount of time after submitting the form I get 500 internal server error? I have already search Stack Overflow for this question but no use? I am directing my form to my LoginController which is <?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed'); print_r( debug_backtrace() ); ini_set('memory_limit' '-1'); ini_set('max_execution_time' 3000); class LoginController extends CI_Controller { public function __construct() { parent::__construct(); $this->load->library('session'); $this->load->helper('form'); $this->load->helper('url'); $this->load->helper('html'); $this->load->database(); $this->load->library('form_validation'); } public function index() { //load the login model $this->load->model('login_model'); $qry=$this->login_model->validate(); if($qry) //if user's credentials validated { $data=array( 'username'=>$this->input->post('username') 'is_logged_in'=>TRUE ); $this->session->set_userdata($data); redirect('site/members_area'); } else { $this->index(); } } }?>  My model is: <?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed'); class Login_model extends CI_Model { function __construct() { // Call the Model constructor parent::__construct(); $this->load->database(); } /*//get the username & password from tbl_usrs function get_user($usr $pwd) { $sql = select * from tbl_usrs where username = ' . $usr .

23247121,javascript,I'm currently testing a backbone view with Jasmine and I am having some trouble. I'm trying to isolate the View from all the other elements (the other view that are instantiated the collection) but it is nearly impossible. initialize: function(options) { if(options.return) {return;} var view = this; var name = options.name; var localizedElements = app.helpers.Locale.l().modules.case[name]; var swap notification; this.name = name.capitalizeFirstLetter(); this.collection.on('sort' this.refreshGui this); return this.render('/case/' + name + '/' + this.name + 'Box.txt' localizedElements this.$el).done(function() { new app.views.Buttons({el: view.$el.find('.Buttons')}); _.each(view.collection.models function(model) { new app.views['Folded' + this.name]({model: model el: this.$('table')}); } view); if(!view.collection.findWhere({isPreferred: true}) || !view.collection.findWhere({isPrescribedForms: true})) { if(!view.collection.findWhere({isPreferred: true})) { swap = {entity: 'address' preferenceType: 'preferred'}; notification = app.helpers.Locale.l().generic.warningMessages.missingPreference.swap(swap); var preferredNotification = [notification]; app.helpers.Notification.addNotifications('warnings' {missingPreferred: preferredNotification}); } if(!view.collection.findWhere({isPrescribedForms: true})) { swap = {entity: 'address' preferenceType: 'prescribed forms'}; notification = app.helpers.Locale.l().generic.warningMessages.missingPreference.swap(swap); var prescribedFormsNotification = [notification]; app.helpers.Notification.addNotifications('warnings' {missingPrescribedForms: prescribedFormsNotification}); } } }); }  For example where there are the two ifs  the view is talking to the collection and a helper: Notification Helper . How am I suppose to test this part of the code if I mocked the collection and the notification helper? I mean I am testing the VIEW but now it seems like I have to test other elements of my application in my view...
178449,c++,I have a list view control which at the moment only allows one item to be selected.

458708,javascript,I am working on a JavaScript utility that tells the user the number of 3rd party links embedded into a web page. I'd like to be able to give metrics on how long they took to load (and possibly payload size) much like FireBug but I don't know if I can get at this information using raw JS.

18940090,javascript,Just an odd question not sure quite how to ask and cant find the answer to my question so asking here. Sorry this is a strange and dumb question but I was just fooling around typing random code:  var thing=prompt( what number? ); if(thing<100) { console.log(001001001); } else { console.log(0101001); }  I really made this for no reason and it serves no logical purpose.Its funny because when I type console.log(001001001) the editor I use even says don't use extra leading 0s. Why is it that 001001001 comes out as 262657 and 0101001 prints out 33281 and so on? I'm just curious and I couldn't find this anywhere on google or stackoverflow.
28917996,java,I am studying HBase but can't find for myself answer for one question. Let's consider the following situation. We have five physical (hardware) servers (0-4). Hmaster is installed on server 0 and four hregion servers are installed on server 1-4. And we have one very big table which we need to work with these five servers.  As I understand every region server is responsible for certain region (some set of rows(!)). It means that always one row (including ALL its column familycolumns and cells) is located only in ONE region server (in our example in ONE physical server). If what I wrote is right I can't understand what is the use and importance of column family. Please correct me if I am wrong and/or exmplain what column families are used for.

18704474,java,I am trying to use Hibernate with hbm2ddl.auto set to validate so that Hibernate must respect my DB schema instead of auto-generating tables around my Java classes. A lot of my tables are so-called lookup or reference tables that essentially consist of id name and tag fields: credit_card_types credit_card_type_id Ex: 12 credit_card_type_name Ex: Visa credit_card_type_tag Ex: VISA payment_types payment_type_id Ex: 2 payment_type_name Ex: Google Checkout payment_type_tag EX: GOOGLE_CHECKOUT etc.  I'd like to model these as follows: public class BaseLookup { private Long id; private String name; private String tag; // ...getters setters and ctors etc. } public class CreditCardTypes extends BaseLookup { // .. perhaps a few other fields methods etc... } public class PaymentTypes extends BaseLookup { // .. perhaps a few other fields methods etc... }  The problem is I don't want Hibernate to search for (validate against) a lookups table: I want it to validate aginst 2 lookup tables called credit_card_types and payment_types respectively. What annotations/configs do I need to allow this type of Java inheritance but to only create my 2 lookup tables (and not 3)? Thanks in advance!
10246929,php,If you found the title misleading sorry. I couldn't really come up with a good title for this question. I have two arrays that I'm merging together in a function: $arr1['something']['secondary_something'][]= foo1 ; $arr1['something']['secondary_something'][]= foo2 ; $arr1['something']['secondary_something'][]= foo3 ; $arr2['something']['secondary_something'][]= foo4 ; $arr2['something']['secondary_something'][]= foo5 ; function something($array_ $array_new) { $array=array_merge_recursive($array_$array_new); // to combine/merge both arrays print_r($array);//debugg }  Now that function simply prints this (which is all good): Array ( [something] => Array ( [secondary_something] => Array ( [0] => foo1 [1] => foo2 [2] => foo3 [3] => foo4 [4] => foo5 ) ) )  But I need to work with the new data that has been merged to the primary array. So I need to work $arr2 but only once it has been merged with $arr1.  When I say I need to work with the new data  var_export() is one of the things I need to do with the array.  If I simply do a echo var_export($array_newtrue); I get this: array ( 'something' => array ( 'secondary_something' => array ( 0 => 'foo4' 1 => 'foo5' ) ) )  When I need this: array ( 'something' => array ( 'secondary_something' => array ( 3 => 'foo4' 4 => 'foo5' ) ) )  ^^ Notice how the array keys are 3 and 4 not 1 and 2. Because it has been merged with the primary array ($arr1). Hope you guys understand what I'm trying to do. Any ideas? Thanks xD

11709611,java,So i just got internship at a firm and there we have to work with java. I have been a C guy all my life but i am familiar with the basic OOP fundamentals. Now there is a file ivy.xml. I asked someone what it was and how do i use it and I just got that it resolves all the dependencies in the code. Now can someone help me in understanding what it is what does one mean by the dependency resolution and how do i configure it to my uses? Maybe a simple example can help understanding more quickly. Thanks a tonne.

21470222,java,This code will currently take in an array list and create 10 equal width bins from the floats contained; it will then print the bin ranges. What I am having trouble with is figuring out how to index through the ArrayList and print a star in the correct bin according to the float found. I'm not asking for code; rather a push in the right direction.   public static String getHist( String Tag ArrayList <Float> x) { Float max = getMaximum(x); Float min = getMinimum(x); Float interval = (max - min) / 10f; // System.out.print( Interval: + interval); Float base = min; //System.out.println(Tag); //Loops through for 10 iterations for(Float i = base ; i <= (max - interval); i+= interval) { //System.out.print( Interval: + i + \n ); //prints out the bin range System.out.print(i + - + (base += interval) + | ); //Loop through ArrayList and if a number found belongs within a bin place it // within that appropiate bin //Logic not correct? for(Float index = i; index <= base; index++) { for(Float n : x) { System.out.print( * ); } } System.out.println(); } return Tag; }

22729842,javascript,I've set up a grunt file to automate some of my tasks. I've also split up my watch task into smaller subtasks to prevent it becoming one monolithic watch task. The individual tasks each used to run perfectly fine but now it seems that watch is missing some filechanges as they occur. For example it'll detect a change in my scss and compile that. But it'll miss the subsequent change in the compiled css and skip the autoprefix and ftp-deploy. How can I correct this?

11700121,ios,I would like to seek some help in setting tag for buttons in cells. This is a question with a link to the previous I posted : iOS Using NSDictionary to load data into section and rows  However though I could pass in data dynamically now my renewal button on each of the rows could not seem to get the data and would only detect the same book title of each section when any of the rows in the section is selected.  Based on what I've read so far it's because the button is being recycled hence unable to detect which book is being selected properly. I've tried to set tag: cell.renewButton.tag = indexPath.row;  How my code looks like now:  - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{ static NSString *CellIdentifier = @ Cell ; UserCustomCell *cell = (UserCustomCell *) [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier]; cell.bookTitle.frame = CGRectMake(12 0 550 40); if (cell == nil) { [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@ UserCustomCell owner:self options:nil]; cell = userCustomCell; self.userCustomCell = nil; cell.renewButton.tag = indexPath.row; } if (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) { cell.bookTitle.frame = CGRectMake(12 0 550 40); cell.renewButton.frame = CGRectMake(600 14 68 24); } [cell.renewButton useBlackActionSheetStyle];  //########## EDIT STARTS HERE dataSource = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]; // This would need to be an ivar for (NSDictionary *rawItem in myArray) { NSString *date = [rawItem objectForKey:@ date ]; // Store in the dictionary using the data as the key NSMutableArray *section = [dataSource objectForKey:date]; // Grab the section that corresponds to the date if (!section) { // If there is no section then create one and add it to the dataSource section = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; [dataSource setObject:section forKey:date]; } [section addObject:rawItem]; // add your object } self.dataSource = dataSource; //NSLog(@ Data Source Dictionary: %@  dataSource); NSArray *sections =[[dataSource allKeys] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(caseInsensitiveCompare:)]; NSString *sectionTitle = [sections objectAtIndex:indexPath.section]; NSArray *items = [dataSource objectForKey:sectionTitle]; NSDictionary *dict = [items objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; cell.bookTitle.text = [dict objectForKey:@ name ]; cell.detail.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@ Due Date: %@ Due Time: %@  [dict objectForKey:@ date ] [dict objectForKey:@ time ]]; cell.renewButton.tag = indexPath.row; return cell;  } but it doesn't work at all. Would be sooooo grateful for any suggestions :) Thank you!! P.S: My copy of xcode is not updated only till version4. Saw some people mentioning storing of tag status in DataModel but it's only available in newer versions. :)
15840664,javascript,To increase performance there are many ways to load JavaScript asynchronously as shown in this SO post. However in general these methods do not preserve the ordering if you need it say for dependencies. In what ways can you get the benefit of asynchronous loading but also preserving ordering when needed.  Backbone dependencies are a good example. (require.js jquery.js) -> backbone.js Is there an implementation of promises or queues available from libraries that accomplish this? It does not look like head.js uses promises or queues yet.

21588799,c#,I have a datatable with the following data. Week Score Rank 1 75.8300000000 1 2 76.6800000000 9 3 79.8787870000 4 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0 ... 53 0 0  If the datatable only had the first 3 weeks (weeks with Rank) then the following line would work perfectly. But now I need to add a WHERE clause that gets MAX(Week) where Score is greater than 0. In this case the row returned would be Week 3. Essentially the query would be SELECT max(week) From datatable where Rank > 0 DataRow[] dr = dsRanks.Tables[0].Select( Week = MAX(Week) );  I tried the following but I get an index error because 0 rows are returned. DataRow[] dr = dsRanks.Tables[0].Select( Week = MAX(Week) and Rank > 0 );  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

15987592,c++,I'm wondering if I use static_cast rather than let the compiler find out if an object can be casted and do it by itself may it cost less compilation time or not? Approx. 3000 lines of c++ code I'm taling about. For example:  stack< const something*> myStack; // ... myStack.push(/* not const */ something*)  vs.  stack< const something*> myStack; // ... myStack.push(static_cast< const something*>(something*)).  I've learned ada language in the university and i'm a little confused since then about whether I should do the casting or let the compiler do it.

30789018,php,I have a graphics draw image in which I would like to pass in a variable to represent the height of my image (a rectangle). The variable is part of an array that grabs the number of units in a range from a column in my database.  I echoed the variable $cred0 and it is displaying a number/value in my HTML page. I want to pass the variable/value to another page which draws my graphic in PHP. As of now the image is showing up fine when I set the height with a number: define('IMAGE_WIDTH' 50); define('IMAGE_HEIGHT' 200);  But when I replace the value of the height with the variable the image does not output: define('IMAGE_WIDTH' 50); define('IMAGE_HEIGHT' $cred0);  I am guessing the variable is not being passed into the the graphic draw .php page correctly. I have tried creating an include but that does not display the proper results. Any ideas on how I can pass this variable into another page and use it to replace the value of the height? This is the PHP for the page with the graphic draw (bar_chart_image.php): <?php define('IMAGE_WIDTH' 50); // width of image define('IMAGE_HEIGHT' 200); // height of image // Create the image $img = imagecreatetruecolor(IMAGE_WIDTH IMAGE_HEIGHT); // Background colors $background_color = imagecolorallocate($img 255 224 224); // pink $font_color = imagecolorallocate($img 117 109 109); // gray $line_color = imagecolorallocate($img 42 143 193); // blue $pixel_color = imagecolorallocate($img 0 0 0); // black // Fill the background imagefilledrectangle($img 0 0 IMAGE_WIDTH IMAGE_HEIGHT $background_color); // Lines for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { imageline($img 0 rand() % IMAGE_WIDTH IMAGE_WIDTH rand() % IMAGE_HEIGHT $line_color); } // Random dots for($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) { imagesetpixel($img rand() % IMAGE_WIDTH rand() % IMAGE_HEIGHT $pixel_color); } // Output the image as a PNG using a header header( Content-type: image/png ); imagepng($img); imagedestroy($img); ?>  This is the page that contains the variable information and values (creditLimitTable.php): <?php require_once( ./includes/database_connection.php ); error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors' 1); // VARIABLES FOR CREDIT LIMIT RANGES $cred0 = ''; $cred1_50000 = ''; $cred50001_75000 = ''; $cred75001_100000 =''; $cred_100000 = ''; // QUERY TO GET DATA FROM CREDIT LIMIT COLUMN $credit_limit = 'SELECT creditLimit FROM customers ORDER BY customerNumber ASC'; $result = mysqli_query($dbc $credit_limit) or die ('Error querying database'); ?> <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset='utf-8'> <title>Home</title> <link type= text/css rel= stylesheet href= classic_cars.css /> <style> #table11 { height: 100px; } </style> </head> <body> <p><img src= bar_chart_image.php /></p> <?php require_once( ./includes/navigation.php ); ?> <h1>Credit Limit Table</h1> <div id= table11 > <table border= 1 > <tr> <td>Credit Limit</td> </tr> <?php while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) { $creditLimit = $row['creditLimit']; // SHOW COLUMN WITH DATA echo <tr> <td>$creditLimit</td> </tr> ; // ++ INCREMENT INTO ARRAY IF VALUE IN COLUMN IS WITHIN CERTAIN RANGE if($creditLimit == 0) { $cred0++; } if($creditLimit >= 1 && $creditLimit <= 50000) { $cred1_50000++; } if($creditLimit>= 50001 && $creditLimit <= 75000) { $cred50001_75000++; } if($creditLimit >= 75001 && $creditLimit <= 100000) { $cred75001_100000++; } if($creditLimit > 100000) { $cred_100000++; } // ARRAY $credit_data = array( array('0' $cred0) array('1 to 50000' $cred1_50000) array('50001 to 75000' $cred50001_75000) array('75001 to 100000' $cred75001_100000) array('100000' $cred_100000) ); } // end while loop ?> <!-- DISPLAY HOW MANY TIMES A NUMBER IN SPECIFIED RANGE SHOWS UP --> <p><?php echo $cred0; ?></p> <p><?php echo $cred1_50000; ?></p> <p><?php echo $cred50001_75000; ?></p> <p><?php echo $cred75001_100000; ?></p> <p><?php echo $cred_100000; ?></p> </table> <?php require_once( ./includes/footer.php ); mysqli_close($dbc); ?> </body> </html>

27546059,c++,I'm having some trouble with this code: for (long long int loop = 0; loop < 50000000; loop++) { srand( (unsigned)time(NULL) ); // set the seed int r = abs(rand()); // stores the random seed for this loop int res = loop + r - r * r / r; // random operations with the loop number and the random seed. cout << Loop number: << loop << . << Result: ; cout << res << endl; }//this was missing  If you run that code you can see very clearly in the console that the output of it is only doing the calculations once every few seconds. What's going on? The number should be completely different for each loop because it's doing calculations with random numbers. Instead the number changes every x loops ran and then it only seems to increase between these times it actually does the math. Do I need to specify I want the loop to wait until everything is complete before moving on?
33764020,java|android,I'm learning android app development and I have a button which plays a song when clicked. The code is as follows: Button b=(Button)findViewById(R.id.button1); final MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(this R.raw.song); b.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { if(!mp.isPlaying()) mp.stop(); else mp.start(); } });  Now once a i press the button the media starts and if i press it again it stops. However it fails to stat again when i press it the 3rd time. How do i resolve this? Thanks
700347,jquery,I have a form that uses the excellent jQuery validation plugin. This is a multi-stage form one of which involves uploading files which are scanned for viruses before being accepted. As the upload & virus scan can take a while I would ideally like to show the user an interim message preferably in a modal-overlay style which stays around until the results page. In my head this is quite simple but I can't get it working (I have the message code sorted). The trouble seems to be that my message overlay has to trigger after successful validation & without stopping the form from submitting. Is what I'm trying to do even possible? I'm starting to think I'm too close to it and need to look for another solution. Any help would be very much appreciated. EDIT: Incidentally this is a follow-up to a previous question.
35236247,ios,How does one actually use kqueue() for doing simple async r/w's? It's inception seems to be as a replacement for epoll() and select() and thus the problem it is trying to solve is scaling to listening on large number of file descriptors for changes. However if I want to do something like: read data from descriptor X let me know when the data is ready - how does the API support that? Unless there is a complimentary API for kicking-off non-blocking r/w requests I don't see a way other than managing a thread pool myself which defeats the purpose. Is this simply the wrong tool for the job? Stick with aio? Aside: I'm not savvy with how modern BSD-based OS internals work - but is kqueue() built on aio or visa-versa? I would imagine it would depend on whether the OS io subsystem system is fundamentally interrupt-driven or polling. 
17433136,php,I'm trying to sort a multidimensional array (in fact that it is multidimensional doesn't matter since I'm always only sorting one dimension). function orderSort($a $b) { if ($a['order'] == $b['order']) return 0; return($a['order'] < $b['order']) ? -1 : 1; } $nav = array( section => array( header => array() main => array() ) link => array( header => array() main => array() ) ); $DATA = array( array( type => section  subtype => main  data => array( name => /Basic  order => 1 parent => bbb ) ) array( type => link  subtype => main  data => array( name => Home  link => array( / ) order => 1 parent => /Basic ) ) ); foreach($DATA as $ele) { if(!array_key_exists($ele['data']['parent'] $nav[$ele['type']][$ele['subtype']])) $nav[$ele['type']][$ele['subtype']][$ele['data']['parent']] = array($ele['data']); else array_push($nav[$ele['type']][$ele['subtype']][$ele['data']['parent']] $ele['data']); } var_dump($nav['section']['main']); echo '<br><br>'; foreach($nav['section']['main'] as $ele) { uasort($ele 'orderSort'); $nav['section']['main'] = $ele; } var_dump($nav['section']['main']);  The first var_dump returns: array(1) { [ bbb ]=> array(1) { [0]=> array(3) { [ name ]=> string(6) /Basic [ order ]=> int(1) [ parent ]=> string(3) bbb } } }  As you can see there is a key named bbb (Sorry for that... highly conceptional). Now the second output: array(1) { [0]=> array(3) { [ name ]=> string(6) /Basic [ order ]=> int(1) [ parent ]=> string(3) bbb } }  Suddenly bbb is gone. In fact the whole array (with only a single element) has disappeared.  My question is can I somehow prevent this from happening? I never asked for this kind of of optimization. Of course sorting this with only one element doesn't make any sense but still.

3770619,c#,I'm working on a web form which works in a following way.  Read email template from database Display email template on a web form in HTML format User adds additional information to the web form and clicks on submit button Before I get to a method which will process that request I get A potentially dangerous Request.Form  I have looked at few articles that advise using .Net 2.0 in one of the web.config sections - that didn't work. I have set requestValidation = false for that page and it didn't work either.  My gut feeling is that I'm doing something fundamentally wrong... HTML template is stored as VarChar(4000) in a database.  I have tried encoding text in a method before I send an email but that didn't work either because the web form never got to executing that method. What other options do I have? I have tried storing plain text in database but then I have issue of tabs and returns etc. Thank you

19663214,javascript|jquery|html,Live JSFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/TXMCv/5/ Question You'll see below very quickly what it is that I'm trying to do. I've positioned two elements with the same background image filtering one and having an unfiltered version on top of it. How can I solve the problem of these images being unaligned? I've tried offset. I've tried absolute positioning but that stops the overflow-hidden.  Possible Messy Solution The only solution that I see is to try and use a different version of the inner image until it lines up. Which is fine in a few hours I could surely get a version that aligns properly but what if I want to change the image in the background? This needs a CSS fix! Note Only tested in Chrome Image Example  CSS @import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Telex); .slider-and-logo-holder { width:100%; height:465px; font-family: 'Telex' sans-serif; } .header-slide-image { left:0px; width:100%; height:390px; background-image:url('images/mys3_slider.jpg'); background-position:0px; transition:background-position 5s; padding-top:70px; } .logo-wrap { margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:790px;; height:425px; } .logo-left { float:left; } .logo-right { float:left; -webkit-transform:rotateZ(90deg); font-size:130px; margin-left:-50px; line-height:330px } .title-box { width:580px; height:270px; border-style:solid; border-width:17px; color:#4c4c4c; margin-top:100px; } .title-left { font-size:120px; width:190px; line-height:190px; margin-left:10px; overflow:hidden; color:#fbfbfb; float:left; } .title-right { font-size:340px; margin-top:-410px; width:50%; color:#664da6; float:left; } .blur { -webkit-filter: sepia(100%); -moz-filter: sepia(100%); -ms-filter: sepia(100%); -o-filter: sepia(100%); filter: sepia(100%); } .clip { overflow:hidden; } .abso1 { position:absolute; z-index:-1; }

23214284,android,Hello I have created an android application in that I wants to GCM Register id. My code is-  GCMRegistrar.checkDevice(this); GCMRegistrar.checkManifest(this); final String regId = GCMRegistrar.getRegistrationId(this); if (regId.equals( )) { GCMRegistrar.register(this SENDER_ID); } Log.v( REG ID:  +regId);  But it gives error like- Resetting backoff for 'Package Name'  What is meaning of this error ? 
1398279,php|javascript,I have an issue going on here. I am using PHP to get values from a database in a php script. What I would ideally like to do is test to see if there is any data to display server side and if there is pop up a javascript window with the values. I have this working right now with javascript. Currently the user can look up data and presses a submit button with an onclick event attached to it that opens the javascript window. I'm also using getemementbyID to grab the value posted in the parent window that gets passed to the child window. Basically the php script is getting bypassed so I can't really do any checks of the data. Bottom line... I want to check to see if data is present BEFORE the window opens if possible. Any ideas?

14126654,java,I've been working on a Bukkit plugin project for a while and I've finally decided to make a formal release. So in my crazy scramble to document everything about my project I decided to clean up some APIs for people that would like to use them. Now I've hit the wall with a single problem though.  Basically in this API you must implement an interface and then register your implementation with a class that manages every implementation and also checks for/registers another variable with the PluginMetrics that are bundled inside the plugin.  Here is my interface with the name and tracker fields being fields of concern: public interface IAction { /** * Name of the action. */ String name = null; /** * Stores args passed to the action by the player. */ String[] args = null; /** * Holds the Metrics tracker object. */ Tracker tracker = null; ... }  And here is the method (and init() method) where all my issues arise: public static void registerAction(final Class a) { try { store.put((String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a); log.exDebug(String.format( Action %s (%s) was registered.  (String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a.getCanonicalName())); try { Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getField( tracker ).get(a); try { OpenAuth.getMetrics().addCustomData(metric); log.exDebug(String.format( Registered Metrics data tracker [%s] from %s.  metric.getColumnName() a.getCanonicalName())); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); // e.printStackTrace(); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering an Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void init() { for (Actions a : Actions.values()) { try { registerAction(a.getAction()); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while initialising Actions enumerator. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } for (Object ob : classLoader.load().getClasses()) { Class c = null; try { c = (Class) ob; } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while casting up external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } try { registerAction(c); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } }  And an example implementation: public class FreezeStick implements IAction { public static final String name = freeze ; public static final Tracker tracker = new Tracker( FreezeStick ); private String[] args = null; private Session attached; private SessionController sc; private final LogHandler log = new LogHandler(); private final String permissible = openauth.action.freeze ; private OAServer server; private boolean used = false; protected OAPlayer sender; protected OAPlayer target; public FreezeStick(OAServer server Session attached) { this.server = server; this.sc = server.getController().getSessionController(); this.attached = attached; this.setSender(this.attached.getPlayer()); } -- etc.. --  Every time Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getDeclaredField( tracker ).get(a); happens it's reported as null. I've tried with a.getField() instead of a.getDeclaredField() but same problem. Both the name and tracker variables receive private static and final when they are declared in the implementations and using a.getField() on the name variable has worked fine ever since I first wrote this. If someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it :)  Also here is the exception that occurs if it helps with figuring out my problem any better: 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth-debug] Action ban (me.maiome.openauth.actions.BanStick) was registered. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth] Exception occurred while adding Action data tracker. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] java.lang.NullPointerException 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.registerAction(Actions.java:65) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.init(Actions.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.bukkit.OpenAuth.onEnable(OpenAuth.java:230) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin.setEnabled(JavaPlugin.java:217) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPluginLoader.enablePlugin(JavaPluginLoader.java:457) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.enablePlugin(SimplePluginManager.java:381) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.loadPlugin(CraftServer.java:278) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.enablePlugins(CraftServer.java:260) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.<init>(CraftServer.java:214) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.PlayerList.<init>(PlayerList.java:52) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedPlayerList.<init>(SourceFile:11) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedServer.init(DedicatedServer.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:399) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.ThreadServerApplication.run(SourceFile:849) 
452390,c++,I have a base class Foo that has an Update() function which I want to be called once per frame for every instance of that class. Given an object instance of this class called foo  then once per frame I will call foo->Update(). I have a class Bar derived from my base class that also needs to update every frame. I could give the derived class an Update() function but then I would have to remember to call its base::Update() function - nothing enforces my requirement that the base::Update() function is called because I have overriden it and could easily just forget to (or choose not to) call the base:Update function. So as an alternative I could give the base class a protected OnUpdate() function which could be made overrideable and call it from the base::Update() function. This removes the onus on me to remember to call base::Update() from the derived update function because I'm no longer overriding it. A Bar instance called bar will have bar->Update() called on it; this will first call the base class' Update() method which will in turn call the overriden OnUpdate() function performing the derived class' necessary updates. Which solves everything. Except. What if I want to derive yet another updatable class this time from the Bar class. Baz (which derives from Bar) also has update requirements. If I put them in Baz's OnUpdate() function I'm back to the original problem in that I'd have to remember to tell Baz's OnUpdate() function to call Bar's OnUpdate() function otherwise Bar's OnUpdate() function wouldn't get called. So really I'd want Bar's OnUpdate() function to be non-overridable and instead for it to call an overridable function after it has done whatever it needed to do perhaps called OnUpdate2()... And if I wanted to derive yet another class? OnUpdate3? OnUpdate4? AfterUpdate? Is there a Better Way?  Further Info: My specific problem domain is a 3d world. I've decided my base class is a Locator (an object with a location and orientation). My first derived class is a PhysicsObject - a Locator that also has mass velocity collision information etc. My next derived class is a Camera - which derives from PhysicsObject. As well as position and velocity it also has information about the viewport depth of field etc.  MattK suggests simplifying the hierarchy - if a Locator is never referred to incorporate it into PhysicsObject. I'm also thinking about how I would go about turning the layout upside down and using composition instead of inheritance. Perhaps a Camera HAS physics properties. Perhaps a PhysicsObject HAS a location. I'll have to think some more about this problem.  I like Uri's approach: Observe the contract. Here's the rule - please follow it. Uri is right in that whatever kind of safeguards I try to put in anyone could circumvent them so perhaps in this case the simplest solution is best. All my update() functions are going to have the requirement of calling their base::update() function. Thanks for the help everyone!

24816456,python,I have been learning the python logging module but have been having problems getting the logging to shutdown after it's done. Here is an example - import logging log = logging.getLogger() log.setLevel(logging.INFO) handler = logging.FileHandler('test.log') handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) formatter = logging.Formatter( fmt='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s' datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' ) handler.setFormatter(formatter) log.addHandler(handler) log.info('log file is open') logging.shutdown() log.info('log file should be closed')  But the module is stilling logging after the logging.shutdown() as the log file looks like this - # cat test.log 2014-07-17 19:39:35 INFO: log file is open 2014-07-17 19:39:35 INFO: log file should be closed  According to the documentation this command should perform an orderly shutdown by flushing and closing all handlers . Should I be doing something else to close the log file ?

But i get the same array for both before and after arrays.I may done a mistake. please show me that. *The arrays contains json objects
402536,c#,I'm in the process of porting some ANSI C++ code to C#... and this is killing me right now. Both tests have value = 6844268.

I've tried every possible combination of types in C# (int uint long ulong Int64...) but no go :( Original value in C++ is unsigned int. Anyone have any ideas? EDIT: Argh I messed up my debugging.

3346018,php,I have a file that goes thru a large data set and splits out the rows in a paginated manner. The dataset contains about 210k rows which isn't even that much it will grow to 3Mil+ in a few weeks but its already slow. I have a first query that gets the total number of items in the DB for a particular WHERE clause combination the most basic one looks like this: SELECT count(v_id) as num_items FROM versions WHERE v_status = 1  It takes 0.9 seconds to run. The 2nd query is a LIMIT query that gets the actual data for that page. This query is really quick. (less than 0.001 s).  SELECT v_id v_title v_desc FROM versions WHERE v_status = 1 ORDER BY v_dateadded DESC LIMIT 0 25  There is an index on v_status v_dateadded I use php. I cache the result into memcace so subsequent requests are really fast but the first request is laggy. Especially once I throw in a fulltext search in there it starts taking 2-3 seconds for the 2 queries.

475584,java,I'm in the process of learning Java and my first project is a calculator however I've run into a snag. I'm trying to get my calculator to let me enter a number then click an operator (+ - x /) enter another number then hit an operator again and have the display update and be able to keep this going. Example I would like to be able to hit the following and have it display the total each time I hit an operator after the first:  a + b / c - d =   The code I have seems (to me) like it should work but it doesn't. What am I doing wrong? The following is the code I'm using when you hit an operator. By default wait is set to false. After running through the class once value1 is stored and wait is set to true and that works fine. From there it doesn't seem to work quite right: class OperatorListener implements ActionListener { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { String input = event.getActionCommand(); // Set display as string String s = display.getText(); if (!wait) { // Convert first input string to double try { value1 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } dec = false; } else { // Convert second input string to double try { value2 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } // Determine operation to be performed if (operator == add ) { value1 = Operators.add(value1 value2); } else if (operator == subtract ) { value1 = Operators.subtract(value1 value2); } else if (operator == multiply ) { value1 = Operators.multiply(value1 value2); } else if (operator == divide ) { value1 = Operators.divide(value1 value2); } // Convert final value to string and display display.setText(Double.toString(value1)); dec = false; } // Determine operator hit if (input.equals( + )) { operator = add ; } else if (input.equals( - )) { operator = subtract ; } else if (input.equals( x )) { operator = multiply ; } else if (input.equals( / )) { operator = divide ; } // Set wait wait = true; } }  EDIT: Updated code to fix some confusion and update the if statement. Even after this the same problem still exists. Also the full source is available here
282746,c#,I'm writing C# code that needs to connect to COM events. I implemented the use of IConnectionPointContainer and IConnectionPoint thus:  IConnectionPointContainer connectionPointContainer = internalGenerator as IConnectionPointContainer; if (connectionPointContainer == null) { Debug.Fail( The script generator doesn't support the required interface - IConnectionPointContainer ); throw new InvalidCastException( The script generator doesn't support the required interface - IConnectionPointContainer ); } Guid IID_IScriptGeneratorEvents = typeof(IScriptGeneratorCallback).GUID; connectionPointContainer.FindConnectionPoint(ref IID_IScriptGeneratorEvents out m_connectionPoint); m_connectionPoint.Advise(this out m_cookie);  The problem is that when the COM server is actually implemented in .Net (say C#) after .Net creates it it handles it as a .Net object not a COM object. Since the .Net object doesn't implement the IConnectionPointContainer interface I get null when trying to cast the object to that interface. Any idea how can i workaround this? I can of course implement IConnectionPointContainer by myself in the C# COM server however I would like a simpler solution which I can easily explain to other developers which need to implement the COM server. P.S I must use IConnectionPointContainer as the COM server may be implemented in non-.Net (C++ Java). Thanks Inbar
19823353,html,I'm busy with HTML and CSS and got stuck with this. I have created a button with :hover and :active options which is centered on the page. Clicking on this button needs to lead to a website. My HTML is: <div> <a href= website ><div id= button >Text</div></a> </div>  The CSS is: body html { height: 100%; } a { text-decoration: none; } #button { text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; padding: 1em 0.5em 0.8em; background-color: white; font-family: Myriad Pro Source Sans Pro Helvetica Arial sans-serif; color: #ff4700; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ff4700; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 50px; -webkit-transition: all .1s ease; -moz-transition: all .1s ease; -ms-transition: all .1s ease; -o-transition: all .1s ease; transition: all .1s ease; } #button:hover { background-color: #ff4700; color: white; border: 1px solid white; } #button:active { background-color: #cc3900; }  The problem lies in the fact that the whole width of the page is clickable at the height of the button and not only the button itself that is 150px wide and is centered on the page. I think I have my divs mixed up and it needs other formatting and precedence but I'm not sure. Thanks for your help! P.S. First time on StackOverflow sorry if I formatted something wrong. Edit: P.P.S. Thank you everyone for your reactions never thought so many would take their time to help! A couple of methods worked but this was easiest to incorporate.  <div> <a href= website style= display:block id= button >Text</a> </div>  Again thanks!
20845951,javascript|php|html,I am trying to execute a js action that automatically sends informations to the URL for future use with php.

585840,php|javascript,I recently tried to use an implementation of map in javascript to create a bunch of items then apply them to an objects add method. Firstly with a bog standard implementation of map. var map = function (fn a) { for (i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { a[i] = fn(a[i]); } }  Setup. var translateMenu = new Menu; var languages = [ ['Chinese'  'zh-CN']  ['German'  'de']  ['French'  'fr']  ['Portugese'  'pt']  ['Hindi'  'hi'] ];  And my function... (not anonymous as it's later used when adding the translateMenu to mainMenu.) var langItem = function (language subMenu) { return new MenuItem(language[0] 'http://translate.google.com/translate?u=www.example.com&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&tl=en&sl=' + language[1]   subMenu); } map ( langItem  languages );  This all worked fine I now had an array of MenuItems to throw around. Trying to call map( Menu.add  languages ) would result in internal variables of Menu being undefined and the call failing. Now I'm certain this has to do with the scope of the Menu.add() method so i thought if I passed in the object as well it might work.  I tried creating a new map function that would accept objects and functions but had the same undefined error. objMap (fn  obj  a) { for (i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { obj.fn(a); } } objMap ( add  translateMenu  languages ); // failed  I worked around this by extending Menu with addAll() to take an array which works fine... Menu.prototype.addAll = function (items){ for (i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { this.add(items[i]); } } translateMenu.addAll( languages ); // yay! but I want a more elegant solution.  Anyway my question is how could I implement map (or a similar generic function) to actually support using object methods as my mapped functions?.

19580268,php,I'm running a web application using server-sent events (eventsource). I've been working to properly set up the apache and PHP configuration files so that the program will accommodate all of my users and not timeout. I've already set the timeout to an appropriate amount of time in both PHP and apache but I'm worried about the Server limit Max Clients and Max Requests Per Child. I need to connect around 500 users to the php file that runs the eventsource and run a PHP script every time a message is sent to the server.

567710,c#,In C# how can I extract the URL's of any images found when performing a search with Google? I'm writing a little app to get the artwork for my ripped cd's. I played around with the Amazon service but found the results I received were erratic. I can't be bothered to learn the whole Amazon API just for this simple little app though so thought I'd try Google instead. So far I've performed the search and got the result page's source but I'm not sure how to extract the URL's from it. I know I have to use Regex but have no idea what expression to use. All the one's I've found seem to be broken. Any help would be appreciated.
27978244,php, Generated pdf with tcpdf It gives proper output when open it directly to browser when try to send mail instead of download to local machine in first occurance it open properly Forward mail from thunderbird to other user that pdf file is corrupted and showing message like : Adobe reader could not open 'nsmail-3.pdf' because it is either not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged (for example it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded).

22486344,javascript|jquery,So I've this shopping cart as JSON.  [{ tuote :{ id : 2  name : Rengas 2  count :16 price : 120.00 }}{ tuote :{ id : 1  name : Rengas 6  count : 4  price : 25.00 }}{ tuote :{ id : 4  name : Rengas 4  count : 4  price : 85.00 }}]  Formatted here. So I want to prevent from having the same value in there twice and match them by their ids. This is my current solution (buggy as a cockroach doesn't really do the job) as the only time it works is when the matching value is first in the JSON string. for (var i = 0; i < ostoskori.length; i++) { if (ostoskori[i].tuote.id == tuoteID) { addToExisting(tuoteID tuoteMaara); //this doesn't matter it works. break //the loop should stop if addToExisting() runs } if (ostoskori[i].tuote.id != tuoteID) { addNew(tuoteID tuoteNimi tuoteMaara tuoteHinta); //this doesn't matter it works. //break //adding break here will stop the loop //which prevents the addToExisting() function running } }  ostoskori is the json if you're wondering. As you can probably see for each item the JSON has inside it the more times addNew() will run.  So basically if the JSON has a value with the same id as tuoteID addToExisting() should run. If the JSON doesn't have a value same as tuoteID run addNew(). But how?

8870999,javascript|jquery|html,i have a problem with the style manipulation of an HTML object in Chrome. Here is an example: var a = document.createElement('div'); a.style.position = 'absolute'; a.style.display = 'block'; a.style.top = '300px'; a.style.left = '50px'; a.style.height = '100px'; a.style.width = '10px'; a.style.backgroundColor = '#000000'; a.style.zIndex = '200'; a.aW = 10; var a2 = document.createElement('div'); a2.style.position = 'absolute'; a2.style.display = 'block'; a2.style.top = '200px'; a2.style.left = '50px'; a2.style.height = '100px'; a2.style.width = '10px'; a2.style.backgroundColor = '#000000'; a2.style.zIndex = '200'; a2.id = 'a'; a2.aW = 10; document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(a); document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(a2); var b = window.setInterval(function () { a.aW += 10; if (a.aW > 1600) { window.clearInterval(b); } a.style.width = a.aW + 'px'; } 13); $('#a').animate({ width: '1600' } 2000 'linear');  The object which is animated through the setInterval Function is sometimes working slowly if it is run on a normal website. The strange thing is that the Object animated by jQuery runs smoothly oO. (Sorry for my bad English).

368832,php,I have a PHP script (running on a Linux server) that ouputs the names of some files on the server. It outputs these file names in a simple text-only format. This output is read from a VB.NET program by using HttpWebRequest HttpWebResponse and a StreamReader. The problem is that some of the file names being output contain... unusual characters. Specifically the section symbol (§).  If I view the output of the PHP script in a web browser the symbol appears fine. But when I read the output of the PHP script into my .NET program the symbol doesn't appear correctly (it appears as a generic block symbol).  I've tried all the different character encoding options that you can use when reading the response stream (from the HttpWebResponse). I've tried outputting the stream directly to a text file (no good) displaying it in a TextBox (no good) and even when viewing the results directly in the Visual Studio debugger the character appears as a block instead of as the section symbol.  I've examined the output in a hex editor (as suggested by a related question how do you troubleshoot character encoding problems.  When I write out the section symbol (§) from .NET itself the hex bytes I see representing it are c2 a7 (makes sense if it's unicode right? requires two bytes?). When I write out the output from the PHP script directly to a file and examine that with a hex editor the symbol shows up as ef bf bd - three bytes instead of two? I'm at a loss as to what to do - if I need to specify some other character encoding or if I'm missing something obvious about this.  Here's the code that's used to get the output of the PHP script (VB-style comments modified so they appear correctly on this site):  Dim myRequest As HttpWebRequest = WebRequest.Create( http://www.example.com/sample.php ) Dim myResponse As HttpWebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse() // read the response stream Dim myReader As New StreamReader(myResponse.GetResponseStream()) // read the entire output in one block (just as an example) Dim theOutput as String = myReader.ReadToEnd()  Any ideas?   Am I using the wrong kind of StreamReader? (I've tried passing the character encoding in the call to create the new StreamReader - I've tried all the ones that are in System.Text.Encoding - UTF-8 UTF-7 ASCII UTF-32 Unicode etc.) Should I be using a different method for reading the output of the PHP script?  Is there something I should be doing different on the PHP-side when outputting the text?  UPDATED INFO:  The output from PHP is specifically encoded UTF-8 by calling: utf8_encode($file); When I wrote out the symbol from .NET I copied and pasted the symbol from the Character Map app in Windows. I also copied & pasted it directly from the file's name (in Windows) and from this web page itself - all gave the same hex value when written out (c2 a7). Yes the section symbol I'm talking about is U+00A7 (ALT+0167 on Windows according to Character Map). The content-type is set explicitly via header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); right at the beginning of the PHP script.  UPDATE: Figured it out myself but I couldn't have done it without the help from the people who answered. Thank you!

709033,java,I have a Java program running on Windows (a Citrix machine) that dispatches a request to Java application servers on Linux; this dispatching mechanism is all custom. The Windows Java program (let's call it W) opens a listen socket to a port given by the OS say 1234 to receive results. Then it invokes a dispatch service on the server with a business request . This service splits the request and sends it to other servers (let's call them S1 ... Sn) and returns the number of jobs to the client synchronously. In my tests there are 13 jobs dispatched to a number of servers and within 2 seconds all servers have finished processing their jobs and try to send the results back to the W's socket. I can see in the logs that 9 jobs are received by W (this number varies from test to test). So I try to look for the 4 remaining jobs. If I do a netstat on this Windows box I see that 4 sockets are open: TCP W:4373 S5:48197 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S5:48198 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S6:57642 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S7:48295 ESTABLISHED  If I do a thread dump of W I see 4 threads trying to read from these sockets and apparently stuck in java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method).  If I go on each of the S boxes and do a netstat I see that some bytes are still in the Send Queue. This number of bytes does not move for 15 minutes. (The following is the aggregation of netstats on the different machines): Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Addr State tcp 0 6385 S1:48197 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6005 S1:48198 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6868 S6:57642 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6787 S7:48295 W:4373 ESTABLISHED  If I do a thread dump of the servers I see the threads are also stuck in java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method). I would expect a write but maybe they're waiting for an ACK? (Not sure here; would it show in Java? Shouldn't it be handled by the TCP protocol directly?) Now the very strange thing is: after 15 minutes (and it's always 15 minutes) the results are received sockets are closed and everything continues as normal.  This used to always work before. The S servers moved to a different data center so W and S are no longer in the same data center. Also S is behind a firewall. All ports should be authorized between S and W (I'm told). The mystery is really the 15 minute delay. I thought that it could be some protection against DDOS? I'm no network expert so I asked for help but nobody's available to help me. I spent 30 minutes with a guy capturing packets with Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) but for security reasons I cannot look at the result. He has to analyze this and get back to me. I asked for the firewall logs; same story. I'm not root or administrator on these boxes now I don't know what to do... I'm not expecting a solution from you guys but some ideas on how to progress would be great!

1124634,c++,I want to reset an object. Can I do it in the following way? anObject->~AnObject(); anObject = new(anObject) AnObject(); // edit: this is not allowed: anObject->AnObject();  This code is obviously a subset of typical life cycle of an object allocated by in placement new: AnObject* anObject = malloc(sizeof(AnObject)); anObject = new (anObject) AnObject(); // My step 2. // ... anObject->~AnObject(); // My step 1. free(anObject) // EDIT: The fact I used malloc instead of new doesn't carry any meaning  The only thing that's changed is the order of constructor and destructor calls. So why in the  following FAQ  all the threatening appear?   [11.9] But can I explicitly call a destructor if I've allocated my object with new? FAQ: You can't unless the object was allocated with placement new. Objects created by new must be deleted which does two things (remember them): calls the destructor then frees the memory. FQA: Translation: delete is a way to explictly call a destructor but it also deallocates the memory. You can also call a destructor without deallocating the memory. It's ugly and useless in most cases but you can do that.  The destructor/constructor call is obviously normal C++ code. Guarantees used in the code directly result from the in placement new guarantees. It is the core of the standard it's rock solid thing. How can it be called dirty and be presented as something unreliable? Do you think it's possible that the in-placement and non-in-placement implementation of new are different? I'm thinking about some sick possibility that the regular new can for example put size of the memory block allocated before the block which in-placement new obviously would not do (because it doesn't allocate any memory). This could result in a gap for some problems... Is such new() implementation possible?
16757456,python,I would like to create a new dictionary from dictionaries.  all keys in all dictionaries must be present in resulting dictionary all keys must be present only once value for key is highest value from all values in dictionaries  ex.  d1 = {'a':1 'b':3} d2 = {'a':5 'd':5} d3 = {'c':2 'f':1} d = {'a':5 'b':3 'c':2 'd':5 'f':1}  Also I would like keys (that are strings) to be sorted like in my example. I try with update. However it is overwriting existing value with the newest value not the highest value. 
443895,php,I'm using Zend Framework 1.7.2 MySQL and the MySQLi PDO adapter. I would like to call multiple stored procedures during a given action. I've found that on Windows there is a problem calling multiple stored procedures. If you try it you get the following error message:  SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active. Consider using PDOStatement::fetchAll(). Alternatively if your code is only ever going to run against mysql you may enable query buffering by setting the PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY attribute.  I found that to work around this issue I could just close the connection to the database after each call to a stored procedure: if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS 0 3)) === 'WIN') { //If on windows close the connection $db->closeConnection(); }  This has worked well for me however now I want to call multiple stored procedures wrapped in a transaction. Of course closing the connection isn't an option in this situation since it causes a rollback of the open transaction. Any ideas how to fix this problem and/or work around the issue.  More info about the work around Bug report about the problem 
712679,java,Does anybody know of anything that exists in the Java world to map midi note numbers to specific note names and octave numbers. For example see the reference table: http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/Doc/table2.html I want to map a midi note number 60 to it's corresponding note name (MiddleC) in octave 4. I could write a utility class/enum for this but it would be rather tedious. Does anybody know of anything? I'm specifically using this to write a Tenori-On/Monome clone in Java so far so good... Solution This was what I ended up using: String[] noteString = new String[] { C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  B }; int octave = (initialNote / 12) - 1; int noteIndex = (initialNote % 12); String note = noteString[noteIndex];

The server would be used as a central registry of the peers but not used as the primary connection. The server would not interact with the clients in any way except to assign connections between peers to achieve an optimal path between peers. In a first version it would merely be a directory to which all clients connect and the clients can then use the directory to connect to the other clients available for chat. (I hope that explains it a bit more). :)

40912,javascript,I'm looking for a way to check within pageLoad() if this method is raised during load event because of a postback/async postback or because of being loaded and access the first time. This is similar to Page.IsPostback property within code behind page. TIA Ricky
469899,c#,I have a custom c# type like (just an example): public class MyVector { public double X {get; set;} public double Y {get; set;} public double Z {get; set;} //... }  And I want it to databind to TextBox.Text: TextBox textBox; public MyVector MyVectorProperty { get; set;} //... textBox.DataBindings.Add( Text  this MyVectorProperty );  Essentially I need conversion to and from a string for my custom value type. In the text box I want something like x y z that can be edited to update the vector type. I assumed that I could do so by adding a TypeConverter derived class: public class MyVectorConverter : TypeConverter { public override bool CanConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type sourceType) { if (sourceType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertFrom(context sourceType); } public override bool CanConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertTo(context destinationType); } public override object ConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value) { if (value is string) { MyVector MyVector; //Parse MyVector from value return MyVector; } return base.ConvertFrom(context culture value); } public override object ConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) { string s; //serialize value to string s return s; } //... return base.ConvertTo(context culture value destinationType); } }  and associating it with my struct: [TypeConverter(typeof(MyVectorConverter))] public class MyVector { //... }  This appears to complete half of the battle. I can see MyVectorConverter getting called into but something is amiss. It is called to see if it knows how to convert to string then it is called to convert to string. However it is never queried to see if it can convert FROM string nor to actually do the conversion. Furthermore right after an edit in the textbox the old value is immediately replaced (another CanConvertTo and ConvertTo sequence restoring the old value). The end result is that the newly typed entry in the text box is reverted immediately after it is applied.  I feel as if there is just something simple missing. Is there? Is this entire project/approach doomed to failure? Does anyone else attempt such madness? How does one bi-directionally bind a custom multipart type to a string-based control? Solution: Bizarrely all that is needed is for the formatting to be enabled on the Binding object. (thanks Jon Skeet): textBox.DataBindings.Add( Text  this MyVectorProperty ); //FAILS textBox.DataBindings.Add( Text  this MyVectorProperty  true); //WORKS!  Oddly all that my MSDN mentions about this parameter (formattingEnabled) is:   true to format the displayed data; otherwise false   It mentions nothing about it being a requirement for the data to come back from the control (under these conditions).
26833922,javascript,I wrote a spell-checking script that utilizes a long list of words. I formatted this large list of words as a JavaScript object and I load the list as a script. So when it's loaded that very big object is parsed.  dictionary.js var dictionary = { apple : apple  banana : banana  orange : orange }  Formatted this way for instant word validity checking: if (dictionary[ apple ]){ //word is valid }  The problem is that this giant object being parsed causes a significant DOM freeze. How can I load my data structure in a way so that I can parse it piece by piece? How can I store/load my data structure so that the DOM can handle it without freezing?

160298,python,This is a part algorithm-logic question (how to do it) part implementation question (how to do it best!). I'm working with Django so I thought I'd share with that. In Python it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby. Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes: from django.db import models class Car(models.Model): mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative)  and from django.db import models class Mods(models.Model): ...  How does one get a list of Cars grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods? I.e. I want to get a class likeso: Cars_by_common_mods = [ { mods: { 'a' } cars: { 'W1' 'W2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' } cars: { 'X1' 'X2' 'X3' } } { mods: { 'b' } cars: { 'Y1' 'Y2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' 'c' } cars: { 'Z1' } } ]  I've been thinking of something like: def cars_by_common_mods(): cars = Cars.objects.all() mod_list = [] for car in cars: mod_list.append( { 'car': car 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } ret = [] for key mods_group in groupby(list(mods) lambda x: set(x.mods)): ret.append(mods_group) return ret  However that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating. Cheers & thanks!
299636,javascript|html,Does anyone know a good tool that can be run on a page (for asp.net for example) to help to minimize the footprint size of the page? The page will have typical items: HTML Javascript etc. I've heard of Javascript crunchers in the past that will make the size of the code as compact as possible (and obfuscate it I suppose). The goal is to help optimize the page size (make it as small as possible for speed without changing anything). Is this possible?

What can I do in order to process failure inside 'with' statement in a Pythonic way?
493177,java,Our build is annoyingly slow. It's a Java system built with Ant and I'm running mine on Windows XP. Depending on the hardware it can take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete.  Watching overall performance metrics on the machine as well as correlating hardware differences with build times indicates that the process is I/O bound. It also shows that the process does a lot more reading than writing. However I haven't found a good way to determine which files are being read or written and how many times. My suspicion is that with our many subprojects and subsequent invocations of the compiler the build is re-reading the same commonly used libraries many times. What are some profiling tools that will tell me what a given process is doing with which files? Free is nice but not essential.  Using Process Monitor as suggested by Jon Skeet I was able to confirm my suspicion: almost all of the disk activity was reading and re-reading of libraries with the JDK's copies of rt.jar and other libraries at the top of the list. I can't make a RAM disk large enough to hold all the libraries I used but mounting the hottest libraries on a RAM disk cut build times by about 40%; clearly Windows file system caching isn't doing a good enough job even though I've told Windows to optimize for that.  One interesting thing I noticed is that the typical 'read' operation on a JAR file is just a few dozen bytes; usually there are two or three of these followed by a skip several kilobytes further on in the file. It appeared to be ill-suited to bulk reads. I'm going to do more testing with all of my third-party libraries on a flash drive and see what effect that has.
433392,android,How do I use prepared statements in SQlite in Android?
566186,java,I have many custom editors for a JTable and it's an understatement to say that the usability particularly in regard to editing with the keyboard is lacking. The main reason for this is that my editors are always created with a similar (though often more complex) situation to this: @Override public Component getTableCellEditorComponent(JTable table Object value boolean isSelected int row int column) { JPanel container = new JPanel(); container.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); container.add(field BorderLayout.CENTER); field.setText((String) value); container.add(new JButton( ... ) BorderLayout.EAST); return container; }  I.E a panel with more than one component inside. The actual text editor is a descendant of the component being returned as the editor. So rendering issues aside from what I can tell the JTable is focusing the component that is returned by the getTableCellEditorComponent method so when you press a key with a cell highlighted it passes focus and the key press to the panel thinking that's the editor. Is there anyway I can inform JTable that the real editor is the JTextfield? Adding a hacky requestFocusInWindow on the correct component is insufficient as the key press won't get passed on.
703137,c#,Let's suppose I have this object: [Serializable] public class MyClass { public int Age { get; set; } public int MyClassB { get; set; } } [Serializable] public class MyClassB { public int RandomNumber { get; set; } }  The XmlSerializer will serialize the object like that: <MyClass> <Age>0</age> <MyClassB> <RandomNumber>4234</RandomNumber> </MyClassB> </MyClass>  How can I made the property Age nullable? IE: to not serialize the property Age when it's under 0? I tried with the Nullable but it serialize my object like that: <MyClass> <Age d5p1:nil= true /> <MyClassB> <RandomNumber>4234</RandomNumber> </MyClassB> </MyClass>  By reading the MSDN documentation I found this:  You cannot apply the IsNullable property to a member typed as a value type because a value type cannot contain nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). Additionally you cannot set this property to false for nullable value types. When such types are nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) they will be serialized by setting xsi:nil to true.   source: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlelementattribute.isnullable.aspx I understand a value type can't be set to null. A valuetype is always set to something. The serialization can't make the decision to serialize it or not based on it's current value. I tried with the attributes but it didn't work out. I tried creating an agecontainer object and manipulate it's serialization with attributes but it didn't work out. What I really want is: <MyClass> <MyClassB> <RandomNumber>4234</RandomNumber> </MyClassB> </MyClass>  When the property Age is below 0 (zero).   Looks like you'll have to implement custom serialization.  Yeah that's what I though too but I'd like to get away without it. In the application the object is much more complex and I would like to not handle the serialization myself.

307882,jquery,jQuery's draggable functionality doesn't seem to work on tables (in FF3 or Safari). It's kind of difficult to envision how this would work so it's not really surprising that it doesn't. <html> <style type='text/css'> div.table { display: table; } div.row { display: table-row; } div.cell { display: table-cell; } </style> <script src= http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js ></script> <script src= http://dev.jquery.com/view/tags/ui/latest/ui/ui.core.js ></script> <script src= http://dev.jquery.com/view/tags/ui/latest/ui/ui.draggable.js ></script> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ $( .row ).draggable(); }); </script> <body> <div class='table'> <div class='row'> <div class='cell'>Foo</div> <div class='cell'>Bar</div> </div> <div class='row'> <div class='cell'>Spam</div> <div class='cell'>Eggs</div> </div> </div> <table> <tr class'row'><td>Foo</td><td>Bar</td></tr> <tr class='row'><td>Spam</td><td>Eggs</td></tr> </table> </body> </html>  I'm was wondering a) if there's any specific reason why this doesn't work (from a w3c/HTML spec perspective) and b) what the right way to go about getting draggable table rows is. I like real tables because of the border collapsing and row height algorithm -- any alternative that can do those things would work fine.
693782,c#,I have seen the prior questions and answers. In that one question the original poster asked a followup question:  what are the compelling reasons to use msbuild? are there cons?   I didn't see the answer to that. I'd like to know the converse too. What are the compelling features of Nant?  I think for nant cross-platform is big. For msbuild it is the currency and integration with Visual Studio. Does this sound right? Anything else? EDIT/Added: anyone have a feature list comparison? Someone said nant has more features out of the box. Which ones?  Would it make sense to combine these projects combine efforts so as to benefit mutually? Has anyone asked MS if they'd be willing to contribute msbuild to the community like WiX? What are the chances? EDIT2: I just found this prior discussion not sure why I couldn't find it before.
354288,html,I'm having a problem using CSS's display:inline property with the list-style-image: property on <li> tags. Basically I want to output the following: * Link 1 * Link 2  where * represents an image. I'm doing this with the following bit of HTML: <ol class= widgets > <li class= l1 >Link 1</li> <li class= l2 >Link 2</li> </ol>  which is styled with the following bit of CSS: ol.widgets { list-style-type:none; } ol.widgets li { display:inline; margin-left:10px; } ol.widgets li.l1 { list-style-image:url(image1.gif); } ol.widgets li.l2 { list-style-image:url(image2.gif); }  The problem is that when the list items are displayed inline the images associated with the list items do not appear. They do appear if I take out the display:inline property on the <li> tag. Is there a way to make the images appear even when the list items are displayed inline or is that just impossible?
283632,c#,I followed the commonly-linked tip for reducing an application to the system tray : http://www.developer.com/net/csharp/article.php/3336751 Now it works but there is still a problem : my application is shown when it starts ; I want it to start directly in the systray. I tried to minimize and hide it in the Load event but it does nothing. Edit : I could as a poster suggested modify the shortcut properties but I'd rather use code : I don't have complete control over every computer the soft is installed on. I don't want to remove it completely from everywhere except the systray I just want it to start minimized. Any ideas ? Thanks
164901,python,Currently I am hosting a Django app I developed myself for my clients but I am now starting to look at selling it to people for them to host themselves. My question is this: How can I package up and sell a Django app while protecting its code from pirating or theft? Distributing a bunch of .py files doesn't sound like a good idea as the people I sell it to too could just make copies of them and pass them on. I think for the purpose of this problem it would be safe to assume that everyone who buys this would be running the same (LAMP) setup.
348408,java,I'm a little new to the Java 5 annotations and I'm curious if either of these are possible: This annotation would generate a simple getter and setter for you. @attribute private String var = ;  The @NotNull annotation indicates that a variable connot be null so you don't have to write that boilerplate code every time. /* * @param s @NotNull */ public void setString(String s){ ... }  Will either of these work? They seem like the first things I would write annotations for if I could. Since I don't see much about these when I read the docs I'm assuming that it's not really what annotations are about. Any direction here would be appreciated.

263457,python,I'm pretty sure there should be a more Pythonic way of doing this - but I can't think of one: How can I merge a two-dimensional list into a one-dimensional list? Sort of like zip/map but with more than two iterators. Example - I have the following list: array = [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]]  I want to have result = [12 15 18] # [1+4+7 2+5+8 3+6+9]  So far what I've come up with is: def add_list(array): number_items = len(array[0]) result = [0] * number_items for index in range(number_items): for line in array: result[index] += line[index] return result  But that doesn't look very elegant/Pythonic to me. Aside from not checking if all the lines in the 2D array are of the same length can be added to each other etc. What would be a better way to do it?
86105,javascript,My web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an AJAX call. If the user enters the correct username and password everything is fine but if not the following happens:  The web server determines that although the request included a well-formed Authorization header the credentials in the header do not successfully authenticate. The web server returns a 401 status code and includes one or more WWW-Authenticate headers listing the supported authentication types. The browser detects that the response to my call on the XMLHttpRequest object is a 401 and the response includes WWW-Authenticate headers. It then pops up an authentication dialog asking again for the username and password.  This is all fine up until step 3. I don't want the dialog to pop up I want want to handle the 401 response in my AJAX callback function. (For example by displaying an error message on the login page.) I want the user to re-enter their username and password of course but I want them to see my friendly reassuring login form not the browser's ugly default authentication dialog. Incidentally I have no control over the server so having it return a custom status code (i.e. something other than a 401) is not an option. Is there any way I can suppress the authentication dialog? In particular can I suppress the Authentication Required dialog in Firefox 2 or later? Is there any way to suppress the Connect to [host] dialog in IE 6 and later?  Edit Additional information from the author (Sept. 18): I should add that the real problem with the browser's authentication dialog popping up is that it give insufficient information to the user. The user has just entered a username and password via the form on the login page he believes he has typed them both correctly and he has clicked the submit button or hit enter. His expectation is that he will be taken to the next page or perhaps told that he has entered his information incorrectly and should try again. However he is instead presented with an unexpected dialog box. The dialog makes no acknowledgment of the fact he just did enter a username and password. It does not clearly state that there was a problem and that he should try again. Instead the dialog box presents the user with cryptic information like The site says: '[realm]'. Where [realm] is a short realm name that only a programmer could love. Web broswer designers take note: no one would ask how to suppress the authentication dialog if the dialog itself were simply more user-friendly. The entire reason that I am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers' authentication dialogs to be awful.
206820,c#,I would like to either prevent or handle a StackOverflowException that I am getting from a call to the XslCompiledTransform.Transform method within an Xsl Editor I am writing. The problem seems to be that the user can write an Xsl script that is infinitely recursive and it just blows up on the call to the Transform method. (That is the problem is not just the typical programmatic error which is usually the cause of such an exception.) Is there a way to detect and/or limit how many recursions are allowed? Or any other ideas to keep this code from just blowing up on me?
233467,javascript|html,I know that most links should be left up to the end-user to decide how to open but we can't deny that there are times you almost 'have to' force into a new window (for example to maintain data in a form on the current page). What I'd like to know is what the consensus is on the 'best' way to open a link in a new browser window. I know that <a href= url target= _blank > is out. I also know that <a href= # onclick= window.open(url); > isn't ideal for a variety of reasons. I've also tried to completely replace anchors with something like <span onclick= window.open(url); > and then style the SPAN to look like a link. One solution I'm leaning towards is <a href= url rel= external > and using JavaScript to set all targets to '_blank' on those anchors marked 'external'. Are there any other ideas? What's better? I'm looking for the most XHTML-compliant and easiest way to do this. UPDATE: I say target= _blank is a no no because I've read in several places that the target attribute is going to be phased out of XHTML.

641420,python,Right now I have a central module in a framework that spawns multiple processes using the Python 2.6 multiprocessing module. Because it uses multiprocessing there is module-level multiprocessing-aware log LOG = multiprocessing.get_logger(). Per the docs this logger has process-shared locks so that you don't garble things up in sys.stderr (or whatever filehandle) by having multiple processes writing to it simultaneously. The issue I have now is that the other modules in the framework are not multiprocessing-aware. The way I see it I need to make all dependencies on this central module use multiprocessing-aware logging. That's annoying within the framework let alone for all clients of the framework. Are there alternatives I'm not thinking of?

19438886,html,I am seeing something strange in both firefox and chrome when I increase the zoom level inside these browsers although I see nothing wrong with my CSS... I am hoping someone on this group will be able to help. Here is the whole story: I have a right-floated top-level div containing three right-floated right. The three inner divs have all box-model measurements in pixels which add up to the width of the enclosing container. Everything looks fine when the browser size is 100% but when I start making the browser smaller with CTRL+scrollwheel or CTRL+minus the rightmost margin shrinks down too fast and eventually becomes zero forcing my rightmost floated inner div to fall down below the other two! I can't make sense out of this almost seems like some integer division is being performed incorrectly in the browser code but alas firefox and chrome both display the same result. Here is the example (just zoom out with CTRL-minus to see what I mean): Click Here to View What I Mean on Example Site Just to narrow things down a bit the tags of interest are the following:  div#mainContent div#contentLeft div#contentCenter div#contentRight   I've searched stackoverflow for an answer and found the following posts which seem related to my question but was not able to apply them to the problem I am experiencing:  http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/6955313/div-moves-incorrectly-on-browser-resize http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/18246882/divs-move-when-resizing-page http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/17637231/moving-an-image-when-browser-resizes http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/5316380/how-to-stop-divs-moving-when-the-browser-is-resized  I've duplicated the html and css code below for your convenience: Here is the HTML: <!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset= utf-8 > <title>Pinco</title> <link href= css/style.css rel= stylesheet type= text/css > </head> <body> <div id= wrapper > <header> <div class= logo > <a href= http://pinco.com > <img class= logo src= images/PincoLogo5.png alt= Pinco /> </a> </div> <div class= titolo > <h1>Benvenuti!</h1> <h2>Siete arrivati al sito pinco.</h2> </div> <nav> <ul class= menu > <li><a href= # >Menù Qui</a></li> <li><a href= # >Menù Quo</a></li> <li><a href= # >Menù Qua</a></li> </ul> </nav> </header> <div id= mainContent > <div id= contentLeft > <section> <article> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

EDIT 1: I've checked all measurements again and carefully plugged in numbers until they satisfied the following equation for the three uniform columns in the main area with uniform collapsed margin areas on all sides:  TEXT_AREA * 3 + MARGIN * 4 + BORDER * 6 = 960px (the width of the wrapper) TEXT_AREA = WIDTH + 2 * PADDING BORDER = 1  subject to the margin and padding set to reasonable values of course and here are some numbers which seemed OK which solve these constraints:  TEXT_AREA = 290px MARGIN = 15px BORDER = 1px PADDING = 15px WIDTH = 268px  which translates to the following: div#mainContent { float: left; width: 960px; padding: 15px 0; text-align: justify; } div#contentLeft { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 0 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } div#contentCenter { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 0 0 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; } div#contentRight { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; }  However even now that everything is uniform I still get the problem that when I zoom out the rightmost column falls down below the others. One solution is to do the following: div#contentRight { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 0 /* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; }  so that now the right column has no right margin but the visual result is the same. Now when I zoom out the rightmost column does not fall down but its right margin is so small compared to the others so really there is still a small problem. Edit 2: OK I've done some more searching and found an even better solution. The solution consists in having the margins in between the div column elements the same and having the left and right margin adjust automatically. In order to achieve this I had to do away with floats and use display: inline-block which IMHO is much more suitable than floats and was designed for the purpose at hand: div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; width: 960px; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/*15px*/; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; }  div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; } Now at a normal zoom level all left margins will be 15px plus the last element's right margin which will also be 15px. On the other hand if I zoom out there is some pixel rounding going on but the rounding is applied more or less equally on both sides which is somewhat better. This works in Firefox. Edit 3: Alas I've tried reducing the in-between margins a bit which makes the problem go away with Chrome but one of the div elements still drops down in IE10. div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; overflow: hidden; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */ 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; }  Edit 4: I've come up with a solution which works in Firefox Chrome and IE10. Basically I've created three div wrappers around the three columns and taken measurements again ensuring all measurements are symmetric.

5041202,android,Good day. In my app I have three tab (one Activity extend TabActivity and others activitys provides access to content). In first tab I have ImageView a few TextView and it is works. But when I add ListView and in activity that contain ListView I add a few rows it was not show in may tab. Can someone tell me where I was wrong? Here my code:  In StartActivity:  intent = new Intent().setClass(this GoodsAndShopsActivity.class); spec = tabHost.newTabSpec( shops ).setIndicator( Shops  res.getDrawable(R.drawable.ic_tab_shops)) .setContent(intent); tabHost.addTab(spec);  In GoodsAndShopsActivity: protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.descriptions); m_shopsLayout = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.shops); m_shopList = new ArrayList<Shop>(); m_shopAdapter = new ShopAdapter(m_shopList this); m_shopsLayout.setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE); m_shopsLayout.setAdapter(m_shopAdapter); for (int i = 0; i<3; i++) { m_shopList.add(new Shop( new description )); m_shopAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); } }  In class that extends BaseAdapter: @Override public View getView(int position View convertView ViewGroup parent) { ViewHolder holder; if (convertView == null) { convertView = m_inflater.inflate(R.layout.shop null); holder = new ViewHolder(); holder.descriptions = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.shop); convertView.setTag(holder); } else { holder = (ViewHolder) convertView.getTag(); } String textOnView = m_shops.get(position).getDescription(); holder.descriptions.setText(textOnView); return convertView; } static class ViewHolder{ TextView descriptions; }  And my xml where define ListView (Sorry that so much): <RelativeLayout xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= fill_parent > <LinearLayout android:id= @+id/full_info android:layout_width= wrap_content android:layout_height= wrap_content > <ImageView android:id= @+id/icon android:layout_width= wrap_content android:layout_height= wrap_content android:layout_margin= 10px android:src= @drawable/icon > </ImageView> <LinearLayout android:id= @+id/short_info android:orientation= vertical android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= wrap_content android:layout_toRightOf= @id/icon android:layout_alignParentRight= true > <TextView android:id= @+id/name_for_good android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= 0dip android:layout_weight= 1 android:gravity= center_vertical android:text= Наименование товара > </TextView> <TextView android:id= @+id/best_price android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= 0dip android:layout_weight= 1 android:singleLine= true android:ellipsize= marquee android:text= Лучшая цена: > </TextView> <TextView android:id= @+id/worst_price android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= 0dip android:layout_weight= 1 android:text= Худшая цена: > </TextView> </LinearLayout> </LinearLayout> <LinearLayout android:id= @+id/description_and_shop android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= wrap_content android:layout_below= @id/full_info > <TextView android:id= @+id/description android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= wrap_content android:text= Большое подробное описание товара с всякими деталями нюансами и т.п. > </TextView> <ScrollView android:id= @+id/ScrollView android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= fill_parent > <ListView android:id= @+id/shops android:layout_width= fill_parent android:layout_height= fill_parent > </ListView> </ScrollView> </LinearLayout>   UPDATE: After coffe brake I was find mistake: in my xml I add in last LinearLayout orientation=vertical and my rows appeared.

8202061,c#,This might be a weird question but I know what I'm looking for i just don't know what it's called. I've created a few textboxes with no borders and some labels that go next to them. And in each of these text boxes contains some part of data from a Datatable in these textboxes is a distinct piece of data from the returned rows. Below all of that is a DataColumn that displays the details of all the rows for that particular item.  For the life of me I cannot get this setup to look visually appealing. The textboxes aren't on the same column the datarow is to far apart. Is there a control I'm looking for that would help me out? Instead of creating each element individually?

19959461,c#,Below is the code I will be referring to. A few questions:   Am I able to reference two different .DTSX files within one String pkgLocation = statement? (I did it below) if I am unable to do so and have over 10 different packages to execute programmatically is there a quick and painless way to go about this? Does the code below represent Entity Framework at all? Its been a while since I played with SSIS and I am wondering how to specifically execute it? simply pressing Run shows me nothing within the Test Explorer (probably because its not a test) and when I attempt to Execute it I receive a message stating project with an output type of class library cannot be started directly What does that even mean? Am I on the right track? (with regards to executing these packages programmatically)   public class UnitTest1 { private void Execute_Package() { string pkgLocation = @ C:\tfs\z Reports\BI Projects\Customer Service Data Warehouse\Customer Service Data Warehouse + @ C:\tfs\z Reports\BI Projects\Customer Service Data Warehouse\SRS DataMart SSIS\SRSDimCategorizationLoad.dtsx ; Package pkg; Application app; DTSExecResult pkgResults; Variables vars; app = new Application(); pkg = app.LoadPackage(pkgLocation null); vars = pkg.Variables; vars[ A_Variable ].Value = Some value ; pkgResults = pkg.Execute(); } }   Here is the old code that I made into the code above: private static void LoadTicketLifeCycleSnapShotFact() { ExceutePackage(@ C:\tfs\z Reports\BI Projects\Customer Service Data Warehouse\Customer Service Data Warehouse\SAPBPDataToStage.dtsx ); ExceutePackage(@ C:\tfs\z Reports\BI Projects\Customer Service Data Warehouse\SRS DataMart SSIS\SRSDimCategorizationLoad.dtsx ); 
25319230,html,I found this tutorial on css: http://designshack.net/articles/css/5-simple-and-practical-css-list-styles-you-can-copy-and-paste/ it says css file: * {margin: 0; padding: 0;} div { margin: 20px; } ul { list-style-type: none; width: 500px; } h3 { font: bold 20px/1.5 Helvetica Verdana sans-serif; } li img { float: left; margin: 0 15px 0 0; } li p { font: 200 12px/1.5 Georgia Times New Roman serif; } li { padding: 10px; overflow: auto; } li:hover { background: #eee; cursor: pointer; }  and the html file: <html> <head> <title>title</title> <link href= s.css rel= stylesheet > </head> <body> <div> <ul> <li> <img src= http://lorempixum.com/100/100/nature/1 > <h3>Headline</h3> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p> </li> <li> <img src= http://lorempixum.com/100/100/nature/2 > <h3>Headline</h3> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p> </li> <li> <img src= http://lorempixum.com/100/100/nature/3 > <h3>Headline</h3> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p> </li> <li> <img src= http://lorempixum.com/100/100/nature/4 > <h3>Headline</h3> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>  it worked great but I want to put the css features only to one div not the whole site so I tried to put all css features in class like this: div.list{ * {margin: 0; padding: 0;} div { margin: 20px; } . . . . . . . . . }  and change the html to: <div class= list >  I also tried to put them in .list class but I have lost all the formatting what should I do?

17240880,java,Can somebody explain to me the dumb version of what OpenGL and directX is? Were they both created by pure computer language like java c++ C# Objective C or are they a language all to themselves. In other words LGjWL uses openGL right? So was it created straight from the pure Java API like when you create your own package in java?

I need to skip this files because I don't want other users to track the code or take further updates of code and also it sometimes takes unnecesary space when I take backup of it in my local machine. Now in Eclipse I can easily export or disconnect the project from svn and it will omit the .svn files but there is no such option in Android Studio. Can anyone please help me to do so. Thanks in Advance for trying to help.

6509996,javascript,Do any of the JS compressors allow you to do #ifdef-pre-processing-type things with JScript conditional compilation? If @set to defines a “variable” couldn't a JS compressor remove code that the conditional compilation logic defines at not compiled? I'm a little unsure of JScript syntax but perhaps something like this /*@cc_on @set (@version = 1) @if (@version == 1) alert('Version 1'); @else alert('Not version 1'); @end @*/  could compress into alert('Version 1'); 
7107313,android,In my android service I'm starting a new thread like this  thread = new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { new myClassName(getApplicationContext()); } }); thread.start();  The class is ran in a separate thread because it would otherwise block the service thread (causes timeout). That code is in the onCreate method and is alive the whole time whilst the service is alive (unless it crashes of course). Now I need to have a function in myClassName which returns a String. I've not actually created that function yet but I'm trying to test it with a function which simply returns hello  so let's call that function helloFn .  public String helloFn(String name) { return hello +name; }  How can I call helloFn which is inside the thread I just created from my service? Thanks!

29214845,java|python,I'm trying to use Java client with ZeroMQ. When subscribing to any prefix the Java client matches no messages although a similar Python client matches messages as expected. The Python server context = zmq.Context() socket = context.socket(zmq.PUB) socket.bind( tcp://*:5556 ) for i in range(100): r = XXX + i socket.send_string(r) time.sleep(random.randint(010))  The Python client working fine context = zmq.Context() socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB) socket.connect( tcp://localhost:5556 ) zip_filter = XXX socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE zip_filter) for update_nbr in range(5): s = socket.recv_string() print(s)  The Java client matching no messages context = ZMQ.context(1); subscriber = context.socket(ZMQ.SUB); subscriber.connect( tcp://localhost:5556 ); String filter = XXX ; subscriber.subscribe(filter.getBytes(Charset.forName( UTF-8 ))); while (true) { String msg = subscriber.recvStr(0 Charset.forName( UTF-8 )); // ... }  Using the above Python server the Python client matches all messages starting with XXX as expected. Using the same Python server the Java client matches no messages. Do you have any idea what is wrong with the call to subscribe() in the Java client?

14073723,android,I am creating an Android app and would like to provide several layouts that can be switched by flinging (like Android home screens). I got the layouts to switch be flinging using this code: public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1 MotionEvent e2 float velocityX float velocityY) { if (e1.getX() - e2.getX() > SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { //vFlipper is a ViewFlipper but it is not important for me to have it. As long as I can display several layouts and switch them by thumb touch in a way that the layout will follow the thumb that's fine. if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == 0) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_out)); vFlipper.showPrevious(); } else if (e2.getX() - e1.getX() > SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == vFlipper.getChildCount() - 1) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_out)); vFlipper.showNext(); } return true; }  but this doesn't work quite like the home screen. On the home screen you can pull the screen to the side and see it moving not having to complete the fling and switch the screen. The screen moves with your thumb. My code checks for a complete fling gesture and then fires the switching and the animation. Now I realize a full solution will probably drop the GestureDetector and the onFling method and use the onMove event but I don't know how to implement it and what to put in the onMove method. If you know of a good clear demonstration of this video or written a link will be most appreciated. If you don't care writing such a demonstration that will also be appreciated.

Then finally apply a threshold and average all the pixels above the threshold. The relevant snippet of code is: @Override public void onClick(View v) { Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT fileUri); startActivityForResult(intent CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE); } }); } @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode int resultCode Intent data) { super.onActivityResult(requestCode resultCode data); InputStream stream = null; if(requestCode == CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == RESULT_OK) { try { stream = getContentResolver().openInputStream(data.getData()); bmp = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(stream); bmp.getPixels(pixels 0 bmp.getWidth() 0 0 bmp.getWidth() bmp.getHeight()); for(int x = 0; x < bmp.getWidth(); ++x) { for(int y = 0; y < bmp.getHeight(); ++y) { int index = y * bmp.getWidth() + x; int R = (pixels[index] >> 16) & 0xff; int G = (pixels[index] >> 8) & 0xff; int B = (pixels[index]) & 0xff; double Grey = (0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B); if(Grey > 20) { sum += Grey; count++; } } } } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (stream != null) try { stream.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } //Toast.makeText(this Image saved to:\n + data.getData() Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); double Y = sum / count;  The toast comment is there for testing I used that earlier to make sure the intent was working - it was but the path it gave was  Content://media/external/images/media/##  (where ## is the next photo number). I have tried this in the Eclipse emulator and I get a RuntimeException error at where the bitmap starts. I get a similar crash when I do a live test on an LG Optimus L3 (Android version 2.3.6). I am convinced I have goofed up somewhere in the bitmap part of the code (and yes I have read the developers guide and several threads here and in other places). What is going wrong with the bitmap part?

I'm trying to think of all potential security holes I need to plug one of which is a user pasting in Javascript: <script type= text/javascript > // Do some nasty stuff </script>  Now I know I can strip this out at the server end before saving it and/or serving it back but I'm worried about the possibility of someone being able to paste some script in and run it there and then without even sending it back to the server for processing. Am I worrying over nothing? Any advice would be great couldn't find much searching Google. Anthony
20514972,php,I am using the PHP function imap_open to get emails into a MySQL database. I am using this PHP code to check the subject checking the RE: and # work fine but checking if the subject is Read: doesn't. I have tried echoing substr($subject 75); which displays the 5 digits of the subject which is what I want but its not working in the if statement if(strtolower(substr($subject03)) == 're:') { $ticketnumber = substr($subject 55); } elseif(strtolower(substr($subject01)) == '#') { $ticketnumber = substr($subject 15); } elseif(strtolower(substr($subject05)) == 'Read:') { $ticketnumber = substr($subject 75); } 
251890,c#,I am a rookie was using the Visual Studio 2008 built-in Unit Testing components what would be the best way to record or display your results in a unit test?

1498893,php,I want to migrate to Kohana with my small websites and I'm trying to separate the SQL PHP and the view but I've some problems with this one. I have to tables. Every category can have multiple products. Categories table  id category  Products table  id category_id product  This was my previous code (converted to Kohana's query builder):  $categories = DB::select('id' 'category') ->from('categories') ->as_object() ->execute(); foreach ($categories as $category) { echo '<b>'.$category->category.'</b><br />'; $products = DB::select('product') ->from('products') ->where('category_id' '=' $category->id) ->as_object() ->execute(); foreach($products as $product) { echo $product->product.'<br />'; } echo '<hr />'; }  I want to do the same just in the view file I don't want to use other than echoing out the variables. Update: I would prefer a solution without using Kohana's ORM module. Btw I'm using Kohana 3.0 Update 2: I've accepted Lukasz's last solution but a few modifications are needed to do exactly what I wanted to (note that this is for Kohana 3.0 while Lukasz was working with an older version): SQL code: $products = DB::select(array('categories.category' 'cat') array('products.product' 'prod')) ->from('categories') ->join('products''RIGHT') ->on('products.category_id''category.id') ->as_object() ->execute();  Code in the view file (see comments for explanation):  // Let's define a new variable which will hold the current category in the foreach loop $current_cat = ''; //We loop through the SQL results foreach ($products as $product) { // We're displaying the category names only if the $current_cat differs from the category that is currently retrieved from the SQL results - this is needed for avoiding the category to be displayed multiple times // At the begining of the loop the $current_cat is empty so it will display the first category name if($curren_cat !== $product->cat) { // We are displaying a separator between the categories and we need to do it here because if we display it at the end of the loop it will separate multiple products in a category // We avoid displaying the separator at the top of the first category by an if statement if($current_cat !== '') { //Separator echo '<hr />'; } // We echo out the category echo '<b>'.$product->cat.'</b><br />'; // This is the point where set the $current_cat variable to the category that is currently being displayed so if there's more than 1 product in the category the category name won't be displayed again $current_cat = $product->cat; } // We echo out the products echo $product->prod.'<br />'; }  I hope this was helpful to others as well if anybody has a better solution go on share it!

I guess I would have to wait for it to come or the author recompile it in a previous version. mmyers thanks a lot for your help.

10974610,java,I use HashMaps for storing sets of pairs but I also have to be sure from the first json serialization (from a Php client) and to the Java HashMap set browsing the order of keys will be the same //import com.google.gson.Gson; //import com.google.common.base.Joiner; String s = {\ durant\ :\ kevin\  \ james\ :\ lebron\ \ harden\ :\ james\ \ westbrook\ :\ russel\ } ; System.out.println(s); Gson gson = new Gson(); Type typeOfMap = new TypeToken<Map<String String>>() {}.getType(); Map<String String> m = gson.fromJson(s typeOfMap); List<String> entries = new ArrayList< String>(m.keySet()); //Collections.sort(entries); System.out.println(entries); System.out.println(m.entrySet()); System.out.println( Joiner.on(  ).withKeyValueSeparator( ).join(m) );  It seems working for small sets of values without sorting again (Here by keys alphabetically) but is it a reliable way to do? could the order change between the json String and the Map browsing? Edit: probably LinkedHashMap is more order preserving?

364832,php,So I have the following rows in the DB: 1 | /users/ 2 | /users/admin/ 3 | /users/admin/* 4 | /users/admin/mike/ 5 | /users/admin/steve/docs/ The input URL is /users/admin/steve/ and the goal is to find the URL match from the DB. I want to return #3 as the correct row since the wildcard * specifies that anything can go in place of the asterisk. What would be the most efficient method for doing this? Here's my initial thoughts but I'm sure they could be improved upon:  Make a query to see if there's an exact URL match If no matches then retrieve all rows with * as the last character in reverse order (so the more specific URLs take precedence) For each row if it (minus the * ) matches the input URL then return it If nothing is found then we're SOL

8358891,javascript|ios,I have a web application that uses a div that is not contentEditable. Instead when the div is focused I process key presses and insert / delete / update the innerHTML myself essentially simulating a contentEditable div. I don't care if it's necessarily with javascript but I need a way to trigger the iOS keyboard from a web app.  I've tried floating an invisible text area over the div and when it's focused I hide the text area and shoot focus to the div. This works but as soon as the non-contentEditable div is focused the keyboard disappears. Note that this trick worked until iOS 5. There has to be a way to trigger the iOS keyboard after user interaction in a web app even if we're not on a text element. Any ideas?

7884378,android,I am loading an image onto the screen and i want to be able to drag and drop that image into a part of a grid. I am not sure how to approach this? I have looked on the web but there isnt any good tutorials for dragging and dropping into a gridview. i understand the drop target is a gridview and that will need to accept a drop. ImageView image = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.image1); image.setImageResource(R.drawable.gopher); image.setOnLongClickListener(new OnLongClickListener(){ @Override public boolean onLongClick(View v) { return false; } });  I am ok with loading the image into a grid and then be able to move that image around that grid if thats easier way to go. However as long as the loaded images dont look like there in a grid but i still see the sections of the grid for dropping. Any help / direction is much appreciated.

8510396,c#,I've got a C# code that runs on Azure and is web enabled so it should be safe. That means I can't use pointers. I've got this problem - My Data structure is a SortedList where each node is an object X. Each object X includes an array where each cell is another SortedList of object Y. objects of type X and Y have distinct IDs (so they are searchable of course). Now I need a way to get directly to a Y object without searching it through X objects and then Y objects. (It could be millions on objects) In C/C++ I'd use a list of Y object IDs with pointers to the actual object. Such way I'd search only once for the object. Any ideas how this could be accomplished in C#? Thanks!

1440748,java,I'm working on writing a simple Prolog interpreter in Java. How can I find the last character index of the first element either the head element or the tail element of a string in List Syntax ? List Syntax looks like:  (X) (p a b) (func (func2 a) (func3 X Y)) (equal eve (mother cain))   The head for each of those strings in order are: Head: X  Index: 1 Head: p  Index: 1 Head: func  Index: 4 Head: equal  Index: 5  Basically I need to match the string that immediately follows the first ( and ends either with a space or a closing )  whichever comes first. I need the character index of the last character of the head element. How can I match and get this index in Java?  Brabster's solution is really close. However consider the case of: ((b X) Y) Where the head element is (b x). I attempted to fix it by removing ( from the scanner delimiters but it still hiccups because of the space between b and x . Similarly: ((((b W) X) Y) Z) Where the head is (((b w) x) Y).

For example 3 lines 1047 [main] INFO ibis.Preproc.Ratings - Added AS TIMEZONE to tZones[0] = GMT-12:00 1047 [main] INFO ibis.Preproc.Ratings - Added AS TIMEZONE to tZones[0] = GMT-12:00 1047 [main] INFO ibis.Preproc.Ratings - Added AS TIMEZONE to tZones[0] = GMT-12:00  instead of one line  1047 [main] INFO ibis.Preproc.Ratings - Added AS TIMEZONE to tZones[0] = GMT-12:00  Are there any extra configurations to be done to log4j to avoid this?
327483,python,I'm trying to do the following in python: In a file called foo.py: # simple function that does something: def myFunction(abc): print call to myFunction: abc # class used to store some data: class data: fn = None # assign function to the class for storage. data.fn = myFunction  And then in a file called bar.py: import foo d = foo.data d.fn(123)  However I get the following error:  TypeError: unbound method f() must be called with data instance as first argument (got int instance instead)  This is fair enough I suppose - python is treating d.myFunction as a class method. However I want it to treat it as a normal function - so I can call it without having to add an unused 'self' parameter to the myFunction definition. So the question is: How can I store a function in a class object without the function becoming bound to that class?

89897,c#,Maybe the need to do this is a 'design smell' but thinking about another question I was wondering what the cleanest way to implement the inverse of this: foreach(ISomethingable somethingableClass in collectionOfRelatedObjects) { somethingableClass.DoSomething(); }  i.e. How to get/iterate through all the objects that don't implement a particular interface? Presumably you'd need to start by upcasting to the highest level: foreach(ParentType parentType in collectionOfRelatedObjects) { // TODO: iterate through everything which *doesn't* implement ISomethingable }  Answer by solving the TODO: in the cleanest/simplest and/or most efficient way
57194,java,EDIT: Learned that Webmethods actually uses NLST not LIST if that matters Our business uses the WebMethods integration server to handle most of our outbound communications and its FTP functionality leaves something to be desired. We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I'd appreciate it. When polling two of our partners' FTP servers we connect without issue but when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it's timing out. The actual error is:  com.wm.net.ftpCException: [ISC.0064.9010] java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out  It's being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service. I've logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites. I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows FileZilla and lftp. All without issue. The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell. One is Microsoft FTP the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft. Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory? The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of? This problem is consistent on these two servers. Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it but not when empty. Any thoughts or directions would be appreciated. Thanks! Eric Sipple
20595806,java,This question is regarding sameEnds problem of CodingBat Java section Array-2:  Return true if the group of n numbers at the start and end of the array are the same. For example with {5 6 45 99 13 5 6} the ends are the same for n=0 and n=2 and false for n=1 and n=3. You may assume that n is in the range 0..nums.length inclusive.  The CodingBat server passes code #2 for all cases including other tests but not code #1. Code #1 fails only for the so called other tests . What are those other test cases for which code #1 fails? What is the difference between the two codes? Code #1: public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums int len) { for (int i = 0; i < len && len > 0; i++ len--) if (nums[i] != nums[(nums.length) - len]) return false; return true; }  Code #2: public boolean sameEnds(int[] nums int len) { for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) if (nums[i] != nums[nums.length - len + i]) return false; return true; }

277187,python,I am using BeautifulSoup in Python to parse some HTML. One of the problems I am dealing with is that I have situations where the colspans are different across header rows. (Header rows are the rows that need to be combined to get the column headings in my jargon) That is one column may span a number of columns above or below it and the words need to be appended or prepended based on the spanning. Below is a routine to do this. I use BeautifulSoup to pull the colspans and to pull the contents of each cell in each row. longHeader is the contents of the header row with the most items spanLong is a list with the colspans of each item in the row. This works but it is not looking very Pythonic.  Alos-it is not going to work if the diff is <0 I can fix that with the same approach I used to get this to work. But before I do I wonder if anyone can quickly look at this and suggest a more Pythonic approach. I am a long time SAS programmer and so I struggle to break the mold-well I will write code as if I am writing a SAS macro. longHeader=['''''bananas''''''''''''''''''''trains''''planes'''''''''] shortHeader=['''''bunches''''cars''''trucks''''freight''''cargo''''all other'''''] spanShort=[113131313131313] spanLong=[1131111111113131313] combinedHeader=[] sumSpanLong=0 sumSpanShort=0 spanDiff=0 longHeaderCount=0 for each in range(len(shortHeader)): sumSpanLong=sumSpanLong+spanLong[longHeaderCount] sumSpanShort=sumSpanShort+spanShort[each] spanDiff=sumSpanShort-sumSpanLong if spanDiff==0: combinedHeader.append([longHeader[longHeaderCount]+' '+shortHeader[each]]) longHeaderCount=longHeaderCount+1 continue for i in range(0spanDiff): combinedHeader.append([longHeader[longHeaderCount]+' '+shortHeader[each]]) longHeaderCount=longHeaderCount+1 sumSpanLong=sumSpanLong+spanLong[longHeaderCount] spanDiff=sumSpanShort-sumSpanLong if spanDiff==0: combinedHeader.append([longHeader[longHeaderCount]+' '+shortHeader[each]]) longHeaderCount=longHeaderCount+1 break print combinedHeader

552446,c#|c++,I have a C# class library that contains methods that need to be used with an external application. Unfortunately this external application only supports external APIs in C/C++.  Suppose I have a takeIntReturnDoubleArray method in this C# library that takes an integer and returns an array of doubles. All I need to do is have a C++ method that takes an integer calls the C# library and returns an array of doubles to the calling application.  So in essence the C++ library is just acting as an intermediary between the C# wrapper and the external application.  Is there an easy way to do this? Do I have to do anything special on the C# side to allow it to be imported into C++ easily? I have seen some talk of using the #import statement but I really have no idea what I am doing when it comes to C++. What is the approach I should be taking here?
13250333,java,So far I've accounted for four (4) different places where a GWT developer can inject CSS into a web application:  Inside an HTML host page you can place an HTML link to an external stylesheet such as having MyWebApp/war/hello_gwt.html containing the following line: <link type= text/css rel= stylesheet href= mywebapp/webModule.css > Through the use of implementing ClientBundles that give your app access to binded CssResource subclasses Via UI Binder XML You can include theme/styling in your gwt.xml file like <inherits name= com.google.gwt.user.theme.standard.Standard />  I'm confused about what job each one of these four is supposed to accomplish. In other words how do these CSS mechanisms work together to provide a web app with all the styling it needs or are they just different ways of accomplishing the same thing? Do they each have different pros/cons in different scenarios and if so what are they? I like the strategy of using a Layout or LayoutPanel to position the major display regions of my app and then using CSS to style the individual regions containers etc. So it seems like the first case above (HTML external CSS link) would not be something I'd be looking for seeing that I would want to customize the CSS for each new widget as my UI evolves. I guess I'm just looking for a litmus to go by when trying to choose between my CSS options in GWT-land. Thanks in advance!

344012,c++,UPDATE: Obviously you'd want to do this using templates or a base class rather than macros. Unfortunately for various reasons I can't use templates or a base class.  At the moment I am using a macro to define a bunch of fields and methods on various classes like this: class Example { // Use FIELDS_AND_METHODS macro to define some methods and fields FIELDS_AND_METHODS(Example) };  FIELDS_AND_METHODS is a multi-line macro that uses stringizing and token-pasting operators. I would like to replace this with the following kind of thing class Example { // Include FieldsNMethods.h with TYPE_NAME preprocessor symbol // defined to achieve the same result as the macro. #define TYPE_NAME Example #include FieldsNMethods.h };  Here I #define the name of the class (previously the parameter to the macro) and the FieldsNMethods.h file contains the content of the original macro. However because I'm #including I can step into the code at runtime when debugging. However I am having trouble 'stringizing' and 'token pasting' the TYPE_NAME preprocessor symbol in the FieldsNMethods.h file. For example I want to define the destructor of the class in FieldsNMethods.h so this would need to use the value of TYPE_NAME as below: ~TYPE_NAME() { //... }  But with TYPE_NAME replaced by its value. Is what I'm attempting possible? I can't use the stringizing and token-pasting operators directly because I'm not in a macro definition.

634011,java,I'm developing applications for mobile devices. I've never developed for OSGi and right now I'm considering to get started with it. I've read a lot about using OSGi on mobile phones and it's said to run on J2ME Symbian Windows Mobile Android... But to me it seems as if nobody currently uses it there.  I really would like to exploit the many benefits of OSGi but I know I could do it without. And I don't want to exclude any users who are not able to use OSGi on their phone or would have to go through complicated setup processes make their phones ready for OSGi. And I just can't believe that most of those cheap J2ME phones can run something sophisticated as OSGi. Not talking 'bout $1000 smartphones but rather about those consumer devices you can get from e.g. Sony Ericsson for $100 (or $200 to be fair). Is mobile OSGi a real alternative right now or is it only a nice perspective for future use? Edit: Until now there's only one answer and it states that we're far away from using mobile OSGi. But for me one answer is to few to base important decisions upon so I hope a bounty will attract some more readers.  If no more answers will arrive then that's a sign that nobody has experience with mobile OSGi and then I would conclude the I wouldn't want to be the first one to explore it. Normally I love to try new technologies but this time it's to critical to bet on the wrong horse.
269837,c++,I have a class derived from CTreeCtrl.

I had a look with Spy++ and it also looks like this message never gets sent. What could be the problem here? Update I'm not sure whether this is relevant: The CTreeCtrl's parent window is of type CDockablePane. Could there be some extra work needed for this to work?
660820,c#,I'm using a custom named query with NHibernate which I want to return a collection of Person objects. The Person object is not mapped with an NHibernate mapping which means I'm getting the following exception:  System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.  It's getting thrown when the Session gets created because it can't find the class name when it calls NHibernate.Cfg.Mappings.GetClass(String className).

4070627,android,I started writing my first Android app and chose SDK 2.0.1 before I had an android phone. I wantto test the app on a phone that is Android 1.6. The app itself uses pretty simple stuff so I'm sure its 1.6 compatible but I want to change the SDK level from Eclipse. The default.properties file in my project tree and naively tried to change from Android 6 but it isn't changeable but if I try to change it it tells me to change the build.properties of the project. I don't know what that means. I'm not used to eclipse and am still fumbling around it. I went to the project properties and clicked on Java Build Path  but from there I don't know how to addremove or edit the libraries.  Basically I'm asking how to downgrade my project from inside eclipse so I can export it to a compatible phone.

NameError: global name 'Error' is not defined  Why? Where should I be defining this Error object? I thought it was built-in as a default exception type no?
679657,php,I'm looking for an easy (no database) method of listing how many users are active on a website. The easiest way I can come up with is by counting the number of open sessions. This code should work: $number_of_users = count(scandir(ini_get( session.save_path )));  Of course it won't because of the security constraints on that directory (as there should be!!). Does anyone know another way to access this number without changing directory permissions. Note: I'm looking for an option that does not involve databases or reducing the security on PHP sessions. End Note: For anyone coming to this question I ended up using a cronjob (running every minute) from root that did something similar to: ls /var/lib/php5/ | wc -l > /var/www/sessioncount  Make sure the /var/www/sessioncount file is readable by the apache user. Then you can just read the file in PHP: $number_of_users = file_get_contents( /var/www/sessioncount );

247718,c#,I am calling a SQL proc that has 3 OUTPUT params. After the call to the proc one of the params does not return a value when the other two do. Profiler shows that all 3 values are being returned. The params are declared as follows in the proc... @UsrVariableID INT OUTPUT @OrganisationName NVARCHAR(256) OUTPUT @Visible bit OUTPUT  and the code that calls the proc is like this... cm.Parameters.AddWithValue( @OrganisationName  name); cm.Parameters[ @OrganisationName ].Direction = ParameterDirection.Output; cm.Parameters.AddWithValue( @Visible  visible); cm.Parameters[ @Visible ].Direction = ParameterDirection.Output; cm.ExecuteNonQuery(); name = cm.Parameters[ @OrganisationName ].Value.ToString(); visible = bool.Parse(cm.Parameters[ @Visible ].Value.ToString()); id = int.Parse(cm.Parameters[ @UsrVariableID ].Value.ToString());  The param that fails is @OrganisationName. I'm wondering if its because the param is of type string in the code but NVARCHAR in the proc. Anyone got any ideas?

609332,c++,What is the benefit of declaring the possible exception-throws from a C++ function? In other words what does adding the keyword throw() actually do? I've read that a function declaration such as void do_something() throw(); should guarantee that no exceptions originate from the do_something() function; however this doesn't seem to hold true of functions called within do_something() thus making it a weak guarantee. Please outline the usefulness (and best-use cases) of this language feature.
537381,javascript|jquery,I'm trying to create a simple toggling sidebar using jquery where it expands and contracts when a button is pressed. The button also changes to another type of button when pressed. The sidebar will expand but for some reason it will not move back to it's original position.

We want to have three categories: all-time popularity last week and last day.  Does anybody know of a way to help? I have no idea how to go about doing this and making it efficient. I thought that we could use some sort of cron-job to run every 10 minutes and pull in the number of likes per the last 10 minutes...but I've been told that's pretty inefficient? Help? Thanks!
630006,c#,All the documentation and examples I'm finding online for setting Z-Index to bring an element forward in Silverlight are using a Canvas element as a container. My items are Border elements inside of an ItemsControl container in a DataTemplate. I'm using the MouseEnter and MouseLeave events to trigger an animation on the ScaleTransform.ScaleX and ScaleTransform.ScaleY so they grow when hovered. As they're resized and occupying the same space as other items in the container(s) the most recently added items are overlapping the older items (as opposed to the currently resizing item). Is there a CLEAN way to bring the current item forward in code where I trigger my animation so that they overlap all other items when they're resized?
295731,c#,I have a website built in C#.NET that tends to produce a fairly steady stream of SQL timeouts from various user controls and I want to easily pop some code in to catch all unhandled exceptions and send them to something that can log them and display a friendly message to the user.

5072122,php,i am testing my PHP apps. Intermittently the server prompts me to download chat.php file instead of rendering it... the chat.php is supposed to send header( 'Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8' ); Intermittent here means it happens about 1 out of 15 page requests.. i checked the http headers.   when it is fine it shows POST 200 OK..... when it prompts me to download the php file ... it shows GET  I wonder how did that http header get changed...does it have to do with session_start() or does it have to with my apache/php configurations? or does it have anything to do with content type? I think I should have the right apache config. again the application sometimes asked user to download a php file...I need help on how to debug this problem.. thanks! EDIT: Sorry. not enough sample code available because I am just starting to trouble shoot the headers. All I can say right now is I am using this PHP chat software called cometchat and in the comet_receive.php header('Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8'); if(!empty($response)) { echo json_encode($response); } exit;  you might not even use this software before... I guess I am just asking why the browser only happen in IE :( sometimes get dialog box to download the php file.
15719107,javascript|jquery,Hi i have been trying to do the following. I have a module in a system i am currently designing which is as follows var queryDispatcher = { init: function () { var g = new Array() ; var b = new Array() ; var y = new Array() ; var total_google = 0 ; var total_bing = 0 ; var total_yahoo = 0 ; return { callGoogle: function (query) { var url = 'http://localhost/meta/public/google/'+query ; $.getJSON(url function(data) { total_google = data.searchInformation.totalResults; var i = 0 ; $.each(data.items function() { var obj = new res(i+1 this.title this.snippet this.link 0) ; g.push(obj) ; i=i+1 ; }); }); return true ; } callBing: function (query) { var url = 'http://localhost/meta/public/bing/'+query ; $.getJSON(url function(data) { total_bing = data.d.results[0].WebTotal; var j = 0 ; $.each(data.d.results[0].Web function() { var obj = new res(j+1 this.Title this.Description this.Url 0) ; b.push(obj) ; j=j+1 ; }); }); } callYahoo: function (query) { var url = 'http://localhost/meta/public/yahoo/'+query ; $.getJSON(url function(data) { total_yahoo = data.bossresponse.web.totalresults; var k = 0 ; $.each(data.bossresponse.web.results function() { var obj = new res(k+1 this.title this.abstract this.url 0) ; y.push(obj) ; k=k+1 ; }); }); } getGoogle: function () { } } } };  Now if for example i instantiate queryDispatcher as follows:  var qd = queryDispatcher.init(); var google = qd.callGoogle( hey there );  I should be able to retrieve the results. Currently the results are being pushed into the array g which is empty initally and because of the async getJSON call when i try to return g it is always empty.  How can i wait for the async call to be completed so i can return the array g and the total_google variable?

21704416,c#,I am playing a game called Tibia it's 2D MMORPG and I want to make a fake item creator in the game. There are different items like weapons armory and such. And I want to programmatically change the values of my items to another item. You see each item in the game has an ID. And you equip the items on an inventory slot. Each inventory slot has an address. I could change them easily in CheatEngine. I just find the address for example the Helmet inventory: 5E96F0 And now my current item ID for my helmet is: 5277 That's one of the basic helmets in the game. Now I want the best helmet in the game and I could edit 5277 to ID 9022 by changing value in CheatEngine. How would I do that in C#? This wouldn't change the game anything just the appearance for me and it would be a cool tweak in the game for me haha. How do I inject my Winforms application to Tibia.exe and then find the address 5E96F0 and changes its value?

28748020,c++,I'm fairly new to C++ and thus trying to implement at stack ADT from my knowledge of Java. Here's my header file #include <iostream> #include <cstdlib> template <class S> class stack{ public: Stack(const int): size_(size) top(-1){ if(size_>0){ this->size_ = size; }else{ std::cout<< Stack can be initialized by values greater than 0 << std::endl; } this->top = -1; stack_pointer = new S[this->size_]; }; Stack(const stack& S): size_(S.size_) top_(S.top_){ if(this == &S){ return *this; } stack_pointer = new S[S.size_]; for(int i=0; i< size_; i++){ stack_pointer[i] = S[i]; } this->top = stack_pointer[S.top_]; delete[] S; } ~Stack(){ delete[] stack_pointer; } private: int size_; int top_; S* stack_pointer; };  And here's the cpp #include stack.hpp template<typename S> bool Stack<S>::push(const S& data){ if(this->top_ >= size-1) resize(); stack_pointer[++top_]= data; } void Stack<S>::resize(){ temp = new S[this->size]; for(int i=0; i< size_; i++){ temp[i] = stack_pointer[i]; } delete[] stack_pointer; size_ = size_*2; stack_pointer = new stack_pointer[size_]; for(int j=0; j < size_/2; j++){ stack_pointer[i] = temp[i]; } delete[] temp; } bool Stack<S>::pop(){ if(top>0){ return stack_pointer[top--]; }else{ return false; } } bool Stack<S>::peek(){ if(top>0){ top--; } }  My question is is this the most optimal way to do stack implementation in C++ or are their more efficient ways to do the same. Also does this class need any sort of operator overloading?

394317,c#,I am developing an application in C# that has a form with Windows Media Player embedded inside. There are several links to some online content in my app. and I want user to change the content from one to another with a button click. Since WMP spent some time while buffering for the next content I want to continue playing the current content. There is an event called Buffering in AXWindowsMediaPlayer class that signals when media player finishes buffering the content. But I could not achieve this with a single AXWindowsMediaPlayer object. Whatever I did I could not continue to play the first content while buffering the second. :( Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
17514938,javascript,I have an important task that requires me to do a percentage preloading in Edge animate I looked in the internet and I did not find any tutorials or answers but I found this youtube video which show how to put a preloader and center it and it uses Loading event which I'm new to it. but I think that we can use this event to preload the content specially the images which takes a lot of the size. can anybody give me some code that I can put in this event to preload 3 images for example and show the percentage in a text field (div) in the preload window??

15084301,java,I am writing a piece of code using Java Swing. Basically what it does is that it processes some lengthy task. While the task is running I want to have a waiting pop-up window with a GIF image in it.  My question is that   final InfoDialog infoDialog = new InfoDialog( Parsing file: + fileToBeUploaded.getName()); final File finalFileToBeUploaded = fileToBeUploaded; class FileParsingWorker extends SwingWorker<Void String> { @Override protected Void doInBackground() throws Exception { String text = fileParsers.parseFile(finalFileToBeUploaded); publish(text); return null; } @Override protected void process(List<String> chunks) { infoDialog.setVisible(false); } } infoDialog.setVisible(true); FileParsingWorker fileParsingWorker = new FileParsingWorker(); fileParsingWorker.execute();  The InfoDialog is the small UI pop-up window with a GIF animation in it. Basically I put the lengthy task in the worker but the UI's setVisibles in two places. I am thinking if there is any ways I can run the InfoDialog UI in a thread so that I can reuse that bit of code? The problem I have is that I want to try to run the InfoDialog indefinitely until I deliberately stop it. If I put setVisible(true) in a thread that thread immediately terminates and my UI won't be updated. Can someone show me how to do this?
944502,html,This all started when I wanted a way to hide some content unless requested. I had already used the link:hover method for some tooltips and wanted to take a crack at adapting it for this purpose. I'm avoiding the use of JS because the nature of my site lends itself to use on cellphones--and even where JS is supported it's loading is noticeable and when it fails can make a site frustrating to use. So I've got an an iframe in a div tag in an anchor tag with a timestamp-generated url. Actually hiding the iframe was causing it not to load in IE so I have instead set it's height to 0 until it's in the visited state. Originally I just used the div but the link attributes were carrying over so I introduced the frame. In FF this worked as expected (why would you apply link status to the elements of a frame the link doesn't reside in? (granted the further question why would you ever wrap a frame in an anchor tag in the first place? is valid enough)) but in IE the linked state interferes partially with the functioning of the frame.  The cursor is normal but when you try to click on anything in the frame the regular url-indicating pointer appears briefly. Links within the frame work fine--but forms are tricky. You can only set your caret in a form field on the second click within the frame. The first click seems to put the focus in the frame; afterwards clicks into the form fields work well enough. The final caveat is that nothing can be selected with the mouse within the iframe including any text the user has put in the form field. I've played with z-indexes to no avail and also attempted setting the visibility of the link itself to hidden when visited (which worked but didn't kill the I'm-still-going-to-pretend-I'm-a-link behavior in IE. Thoughts? Relevant code: html: <a id= t-l href= #<?php echo time(); ?>a class=hidebox>save/share<div><iframe src= addtoany.php?pageID=1962460927 frameborder=0></iframe></div></a>  CSS: .hidebox {} .hidebox iframe {height: 0px; width: 300px; background-color:#393242;} .hidebox:visited {} .hidebox:visited div {width:300px; height:400px; padding: 10px 0px 0px 10px;} .hidebox:visited iframe {height: 400px; width: 285px; border: 0px solid #393242; margin: 0px auto 0px auto;}

15934261,php|javascript|jquery,I am creating a text editor in the style of Microsoft Office 2010. Alike Microsoft Office I would like to have a drop down list of all fonts in the following format: <li>Arial</li> <li>Arial Black</li> <li>Arial Narrow</li>  However there are over 500 fonts submitted to Google Fonts and even uploading a fraction of them implementing them into my list with a preview of the font will take hours upon hours of repetitive behavior. Is there a way using the likes of Javascript/JQuery/PHP to speed up the process search a directory on my site and each folder is turned into a new list item or whatnot? Google Fonts Directory: https://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ Hopefully this is useful to mention at the moment; Next to the drop down button to show this list there is an input field of which you can enter a font. I would like to show some form of highlighing if the user manually starts typing. Best Regards Tim

20095035,android,Our client application has means of updating a language file from a server occasionally. Yet it seems quite a challenge to support it on android.. I tried using inflate( XmlPullParser ... ) but later found it doesn't support non-binary XML files. The following are given:  Our app uses @string/resource_id resources to support languages. Basically it supports English but the requirement is to provide language resources dynamically. That is if we need to support Greek or provide a change to the Greek language texts we should be able to provide that on runtime. So on runtime our app connects a service and downloads an XML file with syntax similar to string.xml in the current language.  What remains is how to change the text resources in the application in a sane manner (not one by one..) I tried using inflate(with the XmlPullParser parameter) but it seems to be intended for use with binary pre-compiled XML files. To use that it would require to binarize the XML before hand and that would be less compatible not to say that aapt.exe tool is less documented especially in my case. So any idea?

This because I want to monitor it and the path is a unique key. Is there a property or a way to get the path of the exchange? 
21772936,javascript|jquery,I have a form with some checkboxes which go like this: <input type= checkbox id= id6 value= 3 onclick= optionselect('day''3''id6''50') />  Conditioned on another input I can have these checkboxes checked automatically but for some reason I can't trigger the optionselect . I've tried some of the following but nothing works: $( #id6 ).prop( checked  true).trigger( click ); $( #id6 ).prop( checked  true).triggerHandler( click ); $( #id6 ).prop( checked  true).click();  FYI optionselect just does a bit of math in some other text inputs.

599692,jquery,Again related with my weekend project I'm trying to learn a bit more of web-development. So I'm putting in the list of features i want to implement some stuff i absolutely have no idea how to do. I've been reading tutorials on how to use ajax but i can't find a simple one that i can copy-paste (with one or two changes) to see it work before i go into the how it works. What I've been searching is just a simple example on an ajax function that triggers a mysql insert or update. Anyone as a simple example on how to do this? I think it would prove a nice start to learn it. (Ajax or Json are both ok). Correct me if I'm mystaken: I'm basing myself on this tutorial. So as obviously the client side doesn't have access to database calls what I should do would be something like creating a code snippet to add stuff to the database right? For example create an addcomment.php that can be called with xhr.open(GET addcomment.php?comment=mycomment  true); 
20983527,javascript,I started fiddling with an iframe here: http://jsfiddle.net/M68GL/3 <iframe id= test width= 400 src= http://www.digg.com ></iframe> I want to get rid of the scroll bars and the strange border but can't figure out how to do it. According to: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe the use of the scrolling attribute is deprecated in HTML 5. Also I see no attiribute for the border. Can I just give the element an id and style it using CSS? Using HTML5.

1496942,python,In the computers of our laboratory which have Python 2.6.2 installed in them my program which is an animation of the 2D random walk and diffusion works perfectly.  However I can't get the exact same program to work on my laptop which has Python 2.5. By that not working I mean the animation is screwed; the axis always changes every time the pylab.draw() and pylab.clf() commands are called in a for loop.  I call a pylab.axis([specified axis]) command before and after draw() and clf() to fix the field-of-view  but it's still the same - what I get is a flickering series of image instead of the smooth animation I get when I run the exact same program in our laboratory. I tried to install Python 2.6 in my laptop but I discovered that there is no Numpy for Py2.6. So it is a mystery to me that my program which imports Numpy and uses many of its functions works in our laboratory computer. What can be done with my compatibility problem?

21737647,javascript|jquery,Please consider the following jSfiddle code: http://jsfiddle.net/LYSRp/ What I want : When I click on Reporting checkbox it should check all the checkboxes below it. I mean all check boxes below Reporting  Email Group  SMS Group  States Group  Call Results Group as shown in the image. I think this is what an ideal case will look like What is happening right now: When I click on Reporting  only check boxes that get checked are starting from Report Campaigns to Reporting Test New . Nothing happens to Email Group and it's children checkboxes and similarly for SMS GroupStates Group and Call Results Group. So I have to manually click on email group and other group to select its childrens. I have defined the following function I am using in JSfiddle here: function parentCheckboxCheck(obj childrenClass parentId ){ if(parentId == '' ){ if($(obj).is(':checked')){ $(childrenClass).attr('disabled'false); $(childrenClass).attr('checked'true); } else { $(childrenClass).attr('checked'false); $(childrenClass).attr('disabled'true); } }else{ if($(obj).is(':checked') && $('#'+parentId).is(':checked')){ $(childrenClass).attr('disabled'false); $(childrenClass).attr('checked'true); } else { $(childrenClass).attr('checked'false); $(childrenClass).attr('disabled'true); } } }  JS Fiddle Link: http://jsfiddle.net/VKV7t/1/ Please let me know what I am doing wrong here or what modifications are required?

288735,c#,The long of it is I built an installer in visual studio that gave me this cheery error when I tried to use the program:   Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {EC10E7E8-797E-4495-A86D-3E9EADA6D5BB} failed due to the following error: 80040154.  From that it seems I need to embed the manifest in the executable and to do that I should add as a post build event the following:    $(DevEnvDir)....\VC\bin\mt.exe -manifest $(ProjectDir)$(TargetName).exe.manifest –outputresource: $(TargetDir)$(TargetFileName) ;#1  Well when I do that and build the solution the event is not being called at all. In fact I can put any old random text in the pre and post events and no error is ever given nor do I see anything being called. Is there something that I should be doing differently to make this work? Additional information: I'm building from the IDE. And when I toggle the build types to debug and release I still the correct command in the post build events. Is there a way to see a log of what it's doing?

The reason for doing this is because later on I am inserting page numbers to the pdf where file variable is passed on e.g.

263734,c#,There's a requirement that we will need to support querying a local SQL Server database for new data when the database is updated. Since these are external SQL Server databases we may not be able to use SQL Server Notification Services nor can we make any changes to the database.  My basic idea is to watch for data being written to the database to trigger a query (instead of polling at set intervals). However I'm having a tough time trying to figure out how I could get the WriteFile call from the SqlServr.exe process (as can be monitored in tools such as Sysinternals' Process Monitor). Can anyone direct me to which Win32 functions may be able to help me with this? 
413013,c#,I'm still struggling a bit with OOP concepts and dependency injection so bear with me. I have generated my Linq2Sql model with a User table and now I would like to be able to send a confirmation email to this user so I created a partial class file for my User object and I felt it was natural to add a SendConfirmationEmail() method to the User class. This method will use a MailService to send the actual email and I would like to use dependency injection to pass in the service so I created a constructor overload on the User object like this public User(IMailService service) : this() { _service = service; }  The SendConfirmationEmail method would look like this public void SendConfirmationEmail() { _service.SendMail(params...); }  I realize this is a kind of poor mans dependency injection and I hope to switch to a dependency injection framework later as I am getting more grips on this.  The problem for me is that I need to make a reference from my model dll to my service dll which does not seem right and because I am unsure of how nice my linq2sql generated entities plays with Dependency injection frameworks and OOP concepts (I think ninject looks most promising).  I was hoping someone with a bit more experience than me could tell I'm if I am going in the right direction with this. I know I can make it work but I would like to educate my self in doing it in the correct way in the same step.
631304,php,I'm getting the following error while running the SQL query given below  'Warning: odbc_exec() [function.odbc-exec]: SQL error: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Data type mismatch in criteria expression.

9091609,c++,So I have the following code: void emptyString(char* token int size) { for (int i=0; i < size; i++) token[i] = '\0'; } void setDefaults(char uloginName[] char *home_directory char *password char *shell char *gecos) { emptyString(home_directory sizeof(home_directory) - 1); strcat(home_directory home/home/ ); strcat(home_directory uloginName); } int main(){ char buffer[256]; AccountInfo *tempAccount; UserDB users; char uloginName[9] = Smith ; char homeDirectory[33]; int userID; int groupID; char password[17]; char shell[17]; char gecos[65]; int i j k; char flag[3]; char IDString[6]; char command[11]; char blank = ' '; setDefaults(uloginName homeDirectory password shell gecos); return 0; }  When I run this code in Visual Studio I get a pop up window saying   Run-Time Check Failure #2 - Stack around the variable 'users' was corrupted  This is caused due to the lines of codes in the setDefaults() method. I was hoping someone helped me to correct the code. My intention is to set the value of home_directory to home/home/userloginname where userloginname would be one of the variables being passed as well. EDIT: I just found out the prolem in my code is the strcat() method. If I use strcpy() for the first one it works fine but once I want to add more it shows me a pop up window saying that the variable users got corrupted. Here is the code for the userDB class: class UserDB { private: AccountInfo* _accounts[200]; // store up to 200 accounts unsigned int _size; // number of account stored unsigned int _nextUid; // next user id to be assigned unsigned int _defaultGid; // default group id // other private methods necessary for this class public: // constructors(empty) destructor void adduser( AccountInfo* newUser); void showUsers(); void showPasswd(); void finger(char* userLoginName);class int size(); // return the number of accounts stored (_size) // and other public methods (mutators/setters accessors/getters) };  the code is right now as it is in here. Perhaps I need to make the constructor or destructor or whatnot but as a newbie as have no way of knowing what is actually causing the error and needs to be fixed. EDIT: So after a long while I found out strcat() is what is causing the error however I need to do what strcat claims to do. Here is a copy of my complete code http://ideone.com/A5iWh so that whoever is interested can let me know what to change because I do not know what else to do. Thanks.
8991766,c++,I'm just learning C++ and I'm having difficulties regarding pointers to methods. Lets say: class One { public: int Add (int a int b) {return a+b;} }; typedef int (One::*pAdd) (int int); class Other { public: int Next (pAdd funct int c){ return funct (c 1);} }; int main (){ One one; Other other; other.Next(one.Add 2); return 0; }  I have a number of problems as reported by my MinGW. First I'm not invoking funct correctly as compiler insists on using .* or ->* . Have no idea how to incorporate this request and any help is welcomed. Now I could solve my problems by making methods static to use c-style pointers or pass objects and invoke methods from within Next but I want to understand pointers to methods. Basically I'm puzzled why one.Add is not an acceptable input. Method to call is unambiguously defined (.Add) and conforms my typedef. Also I'm providing instance of class (one) from typedef thus providing context in which method is to be executed. But compiler output looks like I didn't only miss the syntax but like I missed the concept. So how to pass pointer to method with object as context as a single argument?

1384990,php|html,I will do my best to explain my situation and what I have done so far. I am new to php and have tried to learn everything from the net and the forums but now I must post in one. I have a form that is comprised of two pages input.html and output.php. The user completes the form (input.html) and submits it. They are presented with a finished product on their screen (output.php). I have it so a file is created with a unique .html name. The goal is to then email a recipient list with the link to this file on the server. The problem is I wanted the unique file to contain the output.php page with the user data and all I am getting is the php code along with simple html text. Thanks in advance
579993,java,I'm new to Java so this is probably pretty simple but I'm not sure how to make it work. Basically I have a class which I use to draw a grid which extends JPanel. I put this class in a window inside a JScrollPane. The scroll works the way I want it to except the drawing inside my class doesn't update itself once the window scrolls. It does update if the window is resized though. I think I'm supposed to use events/listeners or something like that but I'm not sure where to start looking. edit: also when i open one of the menus and it overlaps on the drawing the region that was covered by the menus isn't updated. Okay let's try again: I have a class called draw. Then I have a GridBagLayout out of draws. This creates the grid I need. I have an object moving around the grid so this way I can update the grid without having to calculate myself the rectangles that have to be updated. Then this grid is inside a JScrollPane which is not subclassed. I use pack() when I create my Window but the thing is the Window may be bigger than the resolution allows so I need it to be scrollable. The scroll works for me but it doesn't update the image when I use it. However resizing the window does update it. What I want is a way to redraw all my window when I click the JScrollPane. And now I also need to redraw the whole thing (or some parts I'll see that later) once I access the menus because the draw parts of the grid under the menus are not updated. That's the best way I can describe it.
487289,html,I'm having trouble with some vertical CSS positioning. I would like to create a page with the following layout: B AAA AAA AAA C AAA  A is a grid (table) of data B is aligned to the top of the grid C is aligned to the bottom of the grid How do I get B and C to align correctly? EDIT: Sorry for the confusion about Div/Table tags! I'm ideally looking to do this with pure CSS but if it's a lot of work then I'll settle for dittodhole's solution of using a table.

669181,php,I'm writing a small algorithm in PHP that goes through n number of movies with ratings and will store the top 5. I'm not reading from a datafile but from a stream so I cannot simply order the movies by rating. My question is what is the most efficent way to keep track of the top 5 rated movies as I read the stream? Currently I do the following:  Read in 5 movies (into an array called movies[]) with two keys movies[][name] and movies[][rating] Order the array by movies[rating] using array_multisort() (highest rating now sits at movies[4]) Read in the next movie If this new movie rating > movies[0][rating] then replace movies[0] with this new movie Re-order the list Repeat 3-5 until finished  My method works but requires a sort on the list after every read. I believe this to be an expensive method mostly due to the fact that every time I use array_multisort() I must do a for loop on 5 movies just to build the index to sort on. Can anyone suggest a better way to approach this?

7553055,c++,I'm trying to make a little program that types for a user using c++. I've found the method keybd_press(...) but it seems as though that only works with the Windows header. Any way to achieve this in Linux? Basically what I want it to do is emulate a key being pressed for me an auto-typer if you will. I'd like it to be ran from the terminal read the input from the user and then type it until the number of times it should be typed is reached. I can do all of that stuff I just can't figure out how to emulate a key being pressed and released. I don't think code is really necessary but this is what I'm working with: #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; int main () { string mystr; cout << What key would you like me to press? ; getline (cin mystr); pressKey(mystr); return 0; } void pressKey(string str) { const int KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY = 0x1; const int KEYEVENTF_KEYUP = 0x2; keybd_event(VkKeyScan(str) 0x45 KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY 0); keybd_event(VkKeyScan(str) 0x45 KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY | KEYEVENTF_KEYUP 0); }  Note: I wouldn't mind using Shell for this if it is better if it is an example would be highly appreciated!
34537066,ios,I am working on an app that allows the user to record audio play it back while changing the pitch then record what they have done as a separate file.

1295991,java,I'm working on a project that requires me to do simple geometrical transformations:  translation reflection over x and y axis  On some figures drawn on a Java applet. The previous guy working on the applet was drawing the figures from arrays representing the caretesian points for the vertices of each figure. I decided to represent the figures as Polygons because it added some nicer organization to the code I could use the arrays he was using to construct one and also because I figured transformations would become easier. After finding Polygon didn't have any methods for reflection I tried another route: I cast the Polygon as a Shape then an Area and then applied a AffineTransform that should have done what I wanted; unfortunately Graphics doesn't have a method to draw Area objects and I couldn't cast back into a shape. So does anyone know of a way to do geometric reflection using Polygons? Or is there some other means through which I could perform this?

1506460,php,I want to use temporary tables in my PHP code. It is a form that will be mailed. I do use session variables and arrays but some data filled in must be stored in a table format and the user must be able to delete entries in case of typos etc. doing this with arrays could work (not sure) but I'm kinda new at the php and using tables seems so much simpler. My problem is that using mysql_connect creates the table and adds the line of data but when i add my 2nd line it drops table and create it again... Using mysql_pconnect works by not dropping the table but creates more than on instance of the table at times and deleting entry's? what a mess! How can I best use temporary tables and not have them droped when my page refreshes? not using temporary tables may cause other issues if the user closes the page and leaving the table in the database.
742119,php,I've gotten a little confused with the PDO::prepare functions. I have something like this array('user_email'=>'hello@net.com''user_pass'=>'password')  and i'd like to translate it into something like this INSERT INTO user_info (user_email user_pass) VALUES (hello@net.com password)  using parameterized queries with PDO (or mysqli I'm open to suggestions). Another idea -  array('uid'=>'10' 'first_name'=>'robert' 'last_name'=>'jones') array( email  number )  into SELECT email number FROM t1 WHERE uid=10 AND first_name=robert AND last_name=jones  I know the answer lies somewhere with PDO::prepare and call_user_func_array but I've gotten really confused on how the latter function works and would appreciate an explanation.
16418668,java,I have been asked to revamp an existing JDialog that is a child container of an in-house Swing app. I will be re-writing the dialog from scratch and have been asked to lead the charge towards making the Swing app resemble a true MVC/MVP architecture (so my JDialog revamp will be the first of many pro-MVC changes to the app itself). I understand MVC/MVP as it pertains to web apps:  Controller - is what the web app framework dispatches to handle HTTP requests; typically consists of multiple methods where each controller method handles the request for a slightly different URL Model - the DAO or POJO/bean representing call-specific data; controller fetches the Model from the DB and injects it into the View View - the mechanism that ultimately produces HTML/JSP that will be sent back to the client/requester  This is not how all MVC/MVP web frameworks operate but is the general idea. But I'm struggling trying to determine how to translate this to a Swing app. In the Swing app you have:  The JDialog itself All the UI widgets (JButtons JTextFields etc.) that make up the view of the dialog The action/event listeners for all the UI widgets which collectively make up the business logic for how the dialog will operate when the user interacts with the view All the other UI glue code (setting which widgets will be enabled/disabled setting their sizes and positions on screen setting their tooltip texts etc.) Plus a lot of other stuff  So I ask: how do I organize all the code necessary for a functioning JDialog using an MVC/MVP architectural pattern? Also if there are any articles tutorials or existing open souce projects that showcase MVC/MVP Swing apps I am interested in them as well. Thanks in advance!
1035561,php,Ok I have several modules in my application in symfony. I have only one module that is secure: on. I also have a layout.php that on top includes a tabbed menu to display links for each module in my application. This menu also has a part where the user is displayed link to 'sign in' if user is not logged in and 'log out' if user is logged in.  When I attempt to visit the module that is secure: on I am forwarded to the sign in page. I can log in fine and the cookie is created. If I go to any other module the menu displays the 'log out' link. Lets say I close the browser (cookie is set to expire in 15 days) and open up browser again and i go to the homepage module. I should be logged in but the menu displays 'sign in' instead (thinking no user is logged in). I try to visit the secure: on module and then when page reloads the menu displays the 'log out' link because it now reads the cookie. What I found out is that if a cookie is set and I close browser and reopen it at the homepage there are two cookies one 'sfRemember' and second 'symfony'. After I visit the secure module and the cookie is read the cookie for 'symony' is totally different from what gets displayed on the homepage - this means its not reading the same cookie and thats why the 'log out' link doesnt appear until I visit the secure module. If after I open that secure module I go back to home page the application reads the cookie just fine and 'log out is displayed'. I really have no clue how to approach this. Any help is greatly appreciated!
278389,c#,I had a problem discovered on another thread here I need to access a COM component that is STA. I'll run it on a dual-core computer a process using this component only reaches 50% of CPU. Unfortunately the owners said they can't change the component to MTA because the component is a hybrid system compiled at Matlab which core is C. So I tried to load two instances of the COM class on the same process different threads accessing it but I couldn't only the last COM instance becomes usable. Do you know anything that could solve this problem? I am considering running two processes of my service on the same computer to achieve 100% cpu. This is not a good solution mainly because this servers will be installed outside our infra.
9251656,java,I am trying to run a batch file with Runtime.exec() and then output its InputStream into a JTextArea. What I have works but only partially. What happens is the batch file runs but if it executes a command other than something like echo that command immediately terminates and the next line executes. For example let's say I try to run a simple batch file like this: @echo off echo hello. waiting 5 seconds. timeout /t 5 /nobreak > NUL echo finished. goodbye.  The batch file executes and the JTextArea says hello. waiting 5 seconds. finished. goodbye.  but it doesn't wait for 5 seconds in the middle. I can't figure out why it's doing this. Here's what I use to run the batch file and read its InputStream. private class ScriptRunner implements Runnable { private final GUI.InfoGUI gui; // the name of my GUI class private final String script; public ScriptRunner(final GUI.InfoGUI gui final File script) { this.gui = gui; this.script = script.getAbsolutePath(); } @Override public void run() { try { final Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(script); StreamReader output = new StreamReader(p.getInputStream() gui); Thread t = new Thread(output); t.start(); int exit = p.waitFor(); output.setComplete(true); while (t.isAlive()) { sleep(500); } System.out.println( Processed finished with exit code + exit); } catch (final Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } private class StreamReader implements Runnable { private final InputStream is; private final GUI.InfoGUI gui; private boolean complete = false; public StreamReader(InputStream is GUI.InfoGUI gui) { this.is = is; this.gui = gui; } @Override public void run() { BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is)); try { while (!complete || in.ready()) { while (in.ready()) { gui.setTextAreaText(in.readLine() + \n ); } sleep(250); } } catch (final Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try { in.close(); } catch (final Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } public void setComplete(final boolean complete) { this.complete = complete; } } public void sleep(final long ms) { try { Thread.sleep(ms); } catch (final InterruptedException ie) { } }  I know my code is pretty messy and I'm sure it contains grammatical errors. Thanks for anything you can do to help!
1132328,jquery,Rather than write my own validation I thought i would use JQuery instead however i'm not finding this easy either. I have a few questions which I hope someone can answer. Firstly the error messages are only appearing when I click submit. How can I get them to appear after exiting each field? Here's my code for validation. Code: $(document).ready(function(){ $( #orderForm ).validate({ rules: { shipFirstName: { required: true } shipFamilyName: { required: true } shipPhoneNumber: { required: true } shipStreetName: { required: true } shipCity: { required: true } billEmailAddress: { required: true } billPhoneNumber: { required: true } billCardNumber: { required: true } billCardType: { required: true } } //end of rules }); // end of validate }); //end of function  This is my HTML code for the form. I won't show the styling but I have changed it to display a red font. Code: <form id= orderForm method= post action= x > <table id= formTable cellpadding= 5 > <tr> <td> <h3>Shipping and Billing Information</h3> </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipFirstname >First Name</label></td> <td><input id= shipFirstName type= text name= shipFirstName maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipFamilyName >Surname</label></td> <td><input id= shipFamilyName type= text name= shipFamilyName maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipPhoneNumber >Contact Telephone Number</label></td> <td><input id= shipPhoneNumber type= text name= shipPhoneNumber maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipStreetName >Street Name</label></td> <td><input id= shipStreetName type= text name= shipStreetName maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipCity >City</label></td> <td><input id= shipCity type= text name= shipCity maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= shipPostalCode >Postal Code</label></td> <td><input id= shipPostalCode type= text name= shipPostalCode maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= billEmailAddress >Email address</label></td> <td><input id= billEmailAddress type= text name= billEmailAddress maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= billPhoneNumber >Contact Telephone Number</label></td> <td><input id= billPhoneNumber type= text name= billPhoneNumber maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= fidelityCardNumber >Fidelity card</label></td> <td><input id= fidelityCardNumber type= text name= fidelityCardNumber maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= billCardNumber >Credit Card Number</label></td> <td><input id= billCardNumber type= text name= billCardNumber maxlength= 30 /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= billCardType >Credit Card Type</label></td> <td><select id= billCardType name= billCardType > <option value= ... > Choose your card... </option> <option value= visa > Visa </option> <option value= mastercard > Mastercard </option> </select></td> </tr> <tr> <td><label for= instructions >Instructions</label></td> <td> <textarea id= instructions name= instructions rows= 8 cols= 30 > Enter your requirements here or comments. </textarea></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan= 2 ><input id= submit type= submit name= Submit value= Submit </td> </tr> </table> </form>  I also want to use regexs for the postcode and fidelity card. How do I incorporate these into the script? Is this right? Where do I put it? $.validator.addMethod('shipPostalCode' function (value) { return /^[A-Z]{2}\d{12}\s\d{12}[A-Z]{2}$/.test(value); } 'Please enter a valid Postal Code'); $.validator.addMethod('fidelityCardNumber' function (value) { return /^[A-Z]{1}([A-Z]|\d){4}\s?([A-Z]|\d){5}\s?([A-Z]|\d){3}\d{1}(\!|\&|\@|\?){1}$/.test(value); } 'Please enter a valid card number');  One final thing. Can this script be put in an external js file easily? I am trying to get as much out of the html file as possible.  Thanks
313359,php,When editing PHP code (I'm not sure if it's specific to that language) and I create a new line in the middle of comma-separated lists that span multiple lines the indent rules always unindent the line I'm leaving. Here's a video of it. This happens in arrays function argument lists etc. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening or any quicker methods of fixing the error than moving up re-indenting it moving down re-indenting (since it gets cleared when you leave the line) and continuing? .vimrc
865412,c#,I am trying to check if a process is running on a remote system.

789816,php,I'm doing a job for a guy with a site online. It's an alien site to me and I'm slowly working through the strange code. I have MAMP locally and my http://localhost/ has many client folders coming off from that. Inside this code there is a lot of $_SERVER['document_root'] commands and references like which are just getting lost on my local PHP dev area. How can I easily set the document_root reference to what it should be (just locally though don't really want to mess with the site files as I'll need to upload them again and don't want to break live site!

My local PHP dev URL for this site is: http://localhost:8888/_CLIENTS/clientsite/www/ ...but in the code the '/' at the beginning of '/images/...' is referencing http://localhost:8888/ ?? Thank you.

23894574,php,I am trying to modify Google's PHP idtoken example to not only return email address (which is does) but also return first and last name. I have modified line 36 from: $client->setScopes('email');  to: $client->setScopes( array( https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile ) );  When examining $token_data is does not contain this information. There was a question previously asked about this but is uses contrib/Google_Oauth2Service.php which is no longer included in the official google-api-php-client so I'd rather not use this approach. What do I need to change in order for the code to return email address first name and last name? Full name would be OK is first/last is not available.

11182691,python,I recently read this post over at Hack a Day Getting root on a Sony TV which uses a script that can be found here for use on Sony Bravia TVs. The script uses BusyBox and my question is based on the README found here. I have two questions about this: 1. What are the steps I have to take in order to compile BusyBox for the mipsel architecture? 2. How do I include the GLibc / Linux kernel versions for your TV in my BusyBox binary?  Has anyone else gotten this trick to work successfully?  Thanks in advance for your help and time.
32403988,c#,I have looked through all of the related posts I could find on this site and I have scoured the Internet...and I am stumped about how to read a WCF's SOAP response before it sends it back to the client. I want to read the response in its final form (with the soap envelop elements included in the XML) and send it to my custom log procedure. Note that I have to use a custom log function provided that accepts the response as a string and sends it to a SQL db (not shown). This has to be handled by the code at runtime for each response; I can't simply use some 3rd party logging/tracer tool. Here is my WCF service code: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Runtime.Serialization; using System.ServiceModel; using System.ServiceModel.Web; using System.Text; using MSADataAccess; using System.Web.Configuration; using System.ServiceModel.Channels; namespace svcIDIVS { public class VINS : IVINS { public string VerifyInsurance(string coverageRequest) { string responseMessage = null; DataAccess da = new DataAccess(); responseMessage = da.VerifyInsurance(coverageRequest); return responseMessage; } } }  I need to read responseMessage along with its SOAP Envelope into a string. It should look something like this: <s:Envelope xmlns:s= http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ > <s:Header /> <s:Body> <VerifyInsuranceResponse xmlns= http://tempuri.org/ > <VerifyInsuranceResult>&lt;CoverageResponseDocument PublicationVersion= 00200809 PublicationDate= 2008-11-05 xmlns= http://www.iicmva.com/CoverageVerification/ &gt; &lt;Detail&gt; &lt;PolicyInformation&gt; &lt;CoverageStatus&gt; &lt;ResponseDetails&gt; &lt;ResponseCode&gt;Unconfirmed&lt;/ResponseCode&gt; &lt;UnconfirmedReasonCode&gt;VIN2&lt;/UnconfirmedReasonCode&gt; &lt;/ResponseDetails&gt; &lt;/CoverageStatus&gt; &lt;OrganizationDetails&gt; &lt;NAIC&gt;14788&lt;/NAIC&gt; &lt;!-- this can be echoed from the request or provide the actual NAIC that has evidence of coverage --&gt; &lt;/OrganizationDetails&gt; &lt;PolicyDetails&gt; &lt;!-- this section can be echoed from the request --&gt; &lt;VerificationDate&gt;07/16/2008 00:00:00&lt;/VerificationDate&gt; &lt;PolicyKey&gt;03K85845&lt;/PolicyKey&gt; &lt;PolicyState&gt;CT&lt;/PolicyState&gt; &lt;/PolicyDetails&gt; &lt;/PolicyInformation&gt; &lt;/Detail&gt; &lt;/CoverageResponseDocument&gt; </VerifyInsuranceResult> </VerifyInsuranceResponse> </s:Body>  
1566438,jquery,I'm trying to create a log-out timer that is governed by a user's requesting data. The issue at hand is that there are some ajax calls that are gets and some are posts. In this case I want to extend the session every time a user does a post but not on a get (there are some background polls etc.).  Looking around the jquery docs I saw the beforesend hook which sounds just about right the problem is that I couldn't figure out how to make $.ajaxsetup be 'post' aware. Any ideas? Thanks Phil

Why? Is there any way to convert UCS-2 to UTF-8 by PHP; then output into <input type= text name= out />?
27412543,javascript,Practicing some JS by creating a basic app integrated with TaffyDB. It stores medical codes. I've tried searching for a solution to this but can't seem to get it working. Goal: On click of button JS function is called passing the innerHTML value into the TaffyDB query which searches by code . It then alerts() the user with the description of that code. Problem: I keep getting undefined when calling the function. TaffyDB snippet: diagnosisCodes = TAFFY([ {code_id:'C001' code:'460' description:'Acute Nasopharyngitis(Common Cold)'} {code_id:'C002' code:'708.2' description:'Urticaria Due to Cold and Heat'} {code_id:'C003' code:'778.2' description:'Cold Injury Syndrome of Newborn'} {code_id:'C004' code:'975.6' description:'Poisoning by Anti-Common Cold Drugs'} ]);  HTML snippet: <h2 class='code_categories' id='diagnosis_title'>Diagnosis Codes</h2> <div id='diagnoses_COLD'> <h4 id='column_titles'>Cold-Related</h4> <button id='button' onclick= testing() >460</button>  JS Function: function testing() { //grab element value: var obj = document.getElementById('button').innerHTML.value; //pass element value into TaffyDB query: var dxDesc = diagnosisCodes({code:obj}).first().description; //'alert' description of the code alert(dxDesc); }  This function returns 'undefined'. However var obj is correctly assigned a string value. Also the query works fine when passing a function parameter. For example this alerts with the correct description: function getDxDesc(name) { var obj2 = diagnosisCodes({code:name}).first().description; alert(obj2); }  My problem is getting the entire thing to work in unison.

32535665,ios,I looked a lot questions and answers for the same issue. And What I know now is that  'didReceiveRemoteNotification' is not called when the app is background. didReceiveRemoteNotification is just called when app is foreground or when user comes to app by tapping notification if its in background. application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is called when user taps on notification to open the app if its killed.  My situation is below:  I'm using parse to push and get notification. I'm successful getting notification when app is foreground and I'm handling data and show alert and list notification at notification list. But I can not get notification when app is background or killed. But I check my app can get notification when my app is background or killed when using 'custom audience' of Parse as I want. (Like other famous applications)  What I want to is I want to get notification when app is background or killed like when I use 'custom audience' of Parse. But when I use just API of Parse  it doesn't work as i want. Is there anything I'm missing now? My registering code is below: - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler{ NSLog(@ didReceiveRemoteNotification executed : %@ userInfo); NSInteger bettingIDX = [[userInfo objectForKey:@ betting_idx ] integerValue]; NSString *message = [userInfo objectForKey:@ message ]; UILocalNotification *notification = [[UILocalNotification alloc] init]; notification.alertBody = [NSString stringWithFormat:@ %@ message]; NSUUID *uuid = [NSUUID UUID]; NSString *notificationKey = [uuid UUIDString]; AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate); [[UIApplication sharedApplication] presentLocalNotificationNow:notification]; } - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken{ NSLog(@ DeviceToken : %@  deviceToken ); PFInstallation *currentInstallation = [PFInstallation currentInstallation]; [currentInstallation setDeviceTokenFromData:deviceToken]; [currentInstallation saveInBackground]; } - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:nil]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications]; [Parse setApplicationId:@ applicationID clientKey:@ clientID ]; [PFAnalytics trackAppOpenedWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setApplicationIconBadgeNumber:0]; }

Same kind of problem with mcrypt_create_iv() when mycrypt extension isn't available. session_id() (with session.entropy_length set to a resonable number) is another route but safe mode sometimes disables the functions needed to regenerate and get the session ID. new COM('CAPICOM.Utilities.1')->GetRandom() is kinda obsolete (Win32 only) and the dll isn't reliably available. new DOTNET('mscorlib' 'System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider') with GetBytes() only works if .NET is installed and is working compatibly with PHP.  What's a better solution?
1202932,java,We use Axis2 to generate web service response of which the body is a xml message that generated from a system using windows 1252 as encoding. Our Axis2 system will wrapped this body inside a soap message using utf8. The message is then send to the caller. However the caller keep reject the message with Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8  The caller system suggest me to take out the encoding attribute in the xml declare of the response. I do not know how to tell axis not to put this setting. Any one know how?
34965753,c++,I've encountered a situation where I gotta do some math in a function into a matrix (the dimensions of this are unknown at compile time so I gotta save it as a pointer) and then equate it to a pointer I pass as argument to the function.  The code throws a segmentation fault each time. I have a sample code here: #include <iostream> using namespace std; void assign(int **a) { int **A = new int* [3]; int i j; for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) A[i] = new int[3]; for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) for(j = 0; j < 3; j++) A[i][j] = 100; a = A; /* equating the pointers */ } int main() { int **ptr; assign(ptr); /* Passing my pointer into the function */ cout << ptr[0][0] << endl; return 0; }  The code is in C++ and it is not an option for me to make the function have a return type other than void. And I don't want to save my matrix on a normal pointer by row/column major - I need to know why this doesn't work.

28150856,java,I've connected a java project (using netbeans) to a MySQL database but I'm having trouble inserting data. If i use this code it inserts just fine: String update = insert into expenses(ExpenseCostPurchase_DateDescription)\n + values('milk' 3.18 '2015-01-23''Grocery'); ;  but when i try and replace the insert values with these predefined values: String ExpenseName; Double ExpenseCost; String ExpenseDate; String ExpenseType;  and then use this code to insert the values: String update = insert into expenses(ExpenseCostPurchase_DateDescription)\n + values(' +ExpenseName+ ' +ExpenseCost+ ' +ExpenseDate+ '' +ExpenseType+ '); ;  I get the error: SQLException: Column 'Cost' cannot be null my cost field in my database is defined as decimal(152) Even more annoyingly when i try and use this code to update as a test: String update = insert into expenses(ExpenseCostPurchase_DateDescription)\n + values(' +ExpenseName+ '3.18' +ExpenseDate+ '' +ExpenseType+ '); ;  i get another error saying:  SQLException: Data truncation: Incorrect date value: 'null' for column 'Purchase_Date' at row 1  this is confuses me a lot because through the database i have no issues with updating the Purchase_Date field in the expenses table with a '2015-01-23'. if its of any use that field is of type date. perhaps it's because the date object in my java is string?
36321359,java|php|android,I am wondering if there is a way to return a mongo collection from php script to java. Lets say that i am connecting to url in my Android application like this: URL url = new URL(SERVER_ADDRESS + db.php ); HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();  where db.php is this: $db = new Mongo('mongodb://.../test'); $c_things = $db->things;  where $c_things is the collection. Could i retrieve/parse $c_things in my app as MongoCollection<Document> format? If there is a tutorial out there is very welcome.
220914,c#,In general at a fairly high level and without building an entire CMS what do I need to know about storing web page content (e.g. say several hundred articles and text up to approx. 2500 words in length) and photos in sql server in a templated web page design? Do I store the actual content in the db or store in the files on the server and just put links in the db? What would some asp.net code look like to display it out of the db and flow it into a css-based layout?

331553,c#,I have a control which the user can resize with the mouse. When they move the right side I just change the width and everything works fine. However when they move the left size I have to change the Left and Width properties. The right hand side of the control visibly twitches showing the old width in the new position.  It still twitches if I set both left and width at once using Bounds; whether or not I use SetStyle with any of UserPaint Opaque OptimizedDoubleBuffer AllPaintingInWmPaint or ResizeRedraw; and whether or not it's double buffered. It still twitches if I call SuspendLayout()/ResumeLayout() on either the control or its parent. How do I stop controls from twitching when I change their left positions and their widths?
11581414,php,I'm having a very strange problem with one of my webpages. It's written in PHP and suddenly today without any changes to the site it started to freeze while loading a certain page (and this page only). Freezing means that half of the page loads and then it stops and looks like the browser is waiting for some more info from the server (same thing in all popular browsers). The page has 2 types of users and it works fine for Admin but freezes for User. The only difference is that the User doesn't have radio buttons for rows of the table in certain status. Now while I was trying to fix this I started with manipulating the code hoping that I will find the part which causes the problem but it turns out that I can delete whichever part of the page and the problem disappears. I can also add a line or two and the problem disappears. Being more specific: doesn't work every time. I added one additional line which adds a hidden field to a form and the problem still occured but I added another one with a different name and now it works. I'm using PHP print function to output each line of code to the browser. What can cause this problem? It's so strange that I just have to know! :) I did some additional testing. Now it works with just one line added. This line is: print <input type=\ hidden\ name=\ a\ value=\ 123456789012345678901234567890\ > ;  If I delete one digit from 123456789012345678901234567890 number it starts freezing again! If I add more digits it still works fine... There is no javascript code scanning for anything after page loads. This is the whole code of that page. It's embeded into index.php The biggest question is: why does it work for 'admin' and doesn't work for 'user' (these are fields from the database) <? //$gdzie = noworodki ; $userx = $_SESSION['userx'];

14072887,javascript,I am building an offline-capable HTML 5 web app for subway users. Often mobile networks are so slow on the subway that page requests take a minute or more to get a response. I would like to offer users the option of switching to offline mode if loading a page takes more than 10 seconds. I have tried to do this with a javascript setTimeout() just before setting window.location to a new page. If the page is still around when the timeout function is called this means the page is taking too long and I prompt the user with a confirm() dialog. If the user taps OK I set window.location = '/offline' which is served out of appcache. This works great most of the time but sometimes the response from the original hyperlink comes back while the confirm dialog is on the screen. On both iOS and Android the presence of the confirm dialog seems to block the original hyperlink from replacing the page. On iOS however dismissing the confirm dialog always takes you to the original page not the offline page. I could probably replace the confirm dialog with a similar floating HTML dialog box on the page but this would not give the user a change to respond at all if the page comes back while the dialog is up. What I really want to do is cancel the hyperlink click. But this seems impossible. Is there any other way to achieve the desired effect?

24716778,php,So here's what my URL looks like  http://localhost/search/s.php?search_query=#hashtag  My first response to this was to use $_GET  $search = htmlspecialchars($_GET['search_query'] ENT_QUOTES 'UTF-8');  So I'd then end up getting nothing since I had a # at the end. So I then tried  $url = http://$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI] ; $path = parse_url($url PHP_URL_PATH); $pathFragments = explode('/' $path); $id = end($pathFragments);  I'd echo $id and yet once again get s.php instead.  So my question is how can I properly do this? I've seen some posts. But none seem to solve my issue.  I'm just trying to get #hashtag.

222444,java,We recently upgraded to Castor 1.2 from version 0.9.5.3 and we've noticed a dramatic drop in performance when calling unmarshal on XML. We're unmarshaling to java classes that were generated by castor in both cases. For comparison using identical XML the time for the XML unmarshal call used to take about 10-20ms and now takes about 2300ms. Is there something obvious I might be missing in our new castor implementation maybe in a property file that I missed or should I start looking at reverting to the old version? Maybe there was something in the java class file generation that is killing the unmarshal call? I might also consider Castor alternatives if there were a good reason to drop it in favor of something else. We're using java 1.5 in a weblogic server.

1428190,jquery|html,I am using a CSS hack where the image is scaled but there is a problem. If the user switches the stylesheet off the image used as the background is shown sometimes the image is really huge. Therefore I need to hide the background div when there is no stylesheet. I've thought about dynamically adding the image via JQuery whilst this works -- it does not take into account whether there is no stylesheet. How do I switch off images or the background div when there is no stylesheet? Thanks.

667608,c++,I am trying to implement the Winding Number Algorithm to test if a point is within another polygon. Although the results from my algorithm are wrong and not consistent. I have been working on this for ages now and it has become a bit of a pain!  I have basically converted pseudo code from notes and websites such as softsurfer.com I successfully detect if my player and building object bounding boxes overlap. I return the result to a struct (BoxResult) which lets me know if there has been a collision and returns the box which it has collided with (Below) struct BoxResult{ bool collide; Building returned; }; void buildingCollision(){ int wn = 0; //winding number count BoxResult detect = boxDetection(); //detect if any bounding boxes intersect if(detect.collide){ //If a bounding box has collided excute Winding Number Algorithm. for(int i = 0; i < player.getXSize(); i++){ Point p; p.x = player.getXi(i); p.y = player.getYi(i); wn = windingNum(detect.returnedp); cout << wn << endl; //Continue code to figure out rebound reaction } } }  I then test for a collision between the building and the player (Below). I have tried 5 different attempts and hours of debugging to understand where the error is occuring however I am implementing the most ineffienct method which just uses maths (Below).  int windingNum(Building & b Point & p){ int result = 0; //Winding number is one if point is in poly float total; //Counts the total angle between different vertexs double wn; for(int i = 0; i <= b.getXSize()-1;i++){ float acs nom modPV modPV1 denom angle; if(i == 3){ //Create the different points PVi . PVi+1 Point PV PV1; PV.x = (b.getXi(i) + wx) * p.x; PV.y = (b.getYi(i) + wy) * p.y; PV1.x = (b.getXi(0) + wx) * p.x; PV1.y = (b.getYi(0) + wy) * p.y; modPV = sqrt( (PV.x * PV.x) + (PV.y * PV.y)); //Get the modulus of PV modPV1 = sqrt( (PV1.x * PV1.x) + (PV1.y * PV1.y)); //Get modulus of PV1 nom = (PV1.x * PV.x) + (PV1.y * PV.y); //Dot product of PV and PV1 denom = modPV * modPV1; //denomintor of winding number equation angle = nom / denom; acs = acos(angle) * 180/PI; //find the angle between the different points total = total + acs; //add this angle to the total angle count } if(i < 3){ //Create the different points PVi . PVi+1 Point PV PV1; PV.x = (b.getXi(i) + wx) * p.x; PV.y = (b.getYi(i) + wy) * p.y; PV1.x = (b.getXi(i+1) +wx) * p.x; PV1.y = (b.getYi(i+1) +wy) * p.y; modPV = sqrt((PV.x * PV.x) + (PV.y * PV.y)); //Get the modulus of PV modPV1 = sqrt((PV1.x * PV1.x) + (PV1.y * PV1.y)); //Get modulus of PV1 nom = (PV1.x * PV.x) + (PV1.y * PV.y); //Dot product of PV and PV1 denom = modPV * modPV1; //denomintor of winding number equation angle = nom / denom; acs = acos(angle) * 180/PI; //find the angle between the different points total = total + acs; //add this angle to the total angle count } } wn = total; if(wn < 360){ result = 0;} if(wn == 360){ result = 1;} return result; }  For reasons I do not understand acs = acos(angle) always returns 1.#IND000. Btw so you know I am just testing the algorithm against another square hence the two if statements if i == 3 and if i < 3.  Also incase you need to know these wy and wx are the world co-ordinates which are translated. Thus moving the player around the world e.g. to move the player forward everything is translated by a minus number for wy. Further a Building object would look something like the following struct below: struct Building { vector<float> x; //vector storing x co-ords vector<float> y; //vector storing y co-ords float ymax ymin xmax xmin //values for bounding box vector<int> polygons; //stores the number points per polygon (not relevant to the problem) }  If anyone can help I would amazingly grateful! I just wish I could see where it is all going wrong! (Something I am sure all programmers have said in there time lol) Thanks for readings...

396448,java,I read elsewhere (a response by hazzen here) that .NET has a binding for the entire Office suite outlined here that allows you to write COM-based methods that you can call from Office. It is intended for automation but you can write any managed code you want and have Excel call into it.  I'm interested in the same thing for Java. My present solution runs a standard Windows program that launches Java whereupon any results are essentially sent to standard out and the intermediate program captures these and feeds the result back in to Excel - also using what amounts to std-out. There has to be a better way! Is there such a binding available for Java? I'd also be pleased by any pointers to web articles or whathaveyou that teach about this kind of integration issue.
1115739,java,I've got a web application with an SQL injection as part of an INSERT statement. It looks like this: INSERT INTO table1 VALUES ('str1' 1 'INJECTION HERE')  I can insert the regular multiple-query injections such as ');truncate table1;-- but due to the fact that Java + MySQL is used it does not allow stacking multiple queries so the above injection would result in an error from MySQL and the second query never gets executed. So basically it seems that all one can achieve from such an injection in the aforementioned architecture is injecting junk data  which is possible without an injection as well. There are more techniques such as using load_file() but that would still not allow me to manipulate the database to the extent I'm looking for. Am I missing something here? Is there some other way to use this injection for gaining control over the database?

List of all friends; I misunderstand how to make Send lives system. If player for now have 0 lives he should have ability ask for friends. That pop-up Invite friends dialog  but how to make that If friend accepted invite It sent live for that user who invited him? Custom invite friends dialog Also how to make custom invite friends dialog like in picture? I have simple (suggested friends and more results) which looks like:  And here is code of that invite friends dialog: <a href= # onclick= FbRequest('This page is amazing check it out!''4d5da12cbbb0'); >Send Request</a> <script type= text/javascript > function FbRequest(message data){ FB.ui({method:'apprequests'message:messagedata:datatitle:'Share this site with your friends'} function(response){ // response.request_ids holds an array of user ids that received the request } ); } // typical application initialization code for your site (function() { var e = document.createElement('script'); e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js'; e.async = true; document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e); }()); window.fbAsyncInit = function() { FB.init({ appId : '00000000000000' session : {} status : true cookie : true xfbml : true }); }; </script>  Select all friends And how to make that when custom invite friends dialog pop-up all friends (50 as I know max) will be selected already? I have script which select automatically all friends (50 maximum) from invite friends list. It working by clicking on the orange box 'Firefox' on top left of your screen and select 'Web developing' -> 'Notepad' then paste code and execute It. Here is code: javascript:elms=document.getElementsByName( checkableitems[] );for (i=0;i<elms.length;i++){if (elms[i].type= checkbox )elms[i].click()};  It select friends sucessfully. But If I try to use this script in my php file It not working. I'm tring this: window.onload = function () { window.onload =FbRequest('This page is amazing check it out!''4d5da07acbbb0'); setTimeout(function() {Select()}9000); } function Select() { var elms = document.getElementsByName( checkableitems[] );for (i=0;i<elms.length;i++){if (elms[i].type= checkbox )elms[i].click()}; }  Could you help me?

7585828,c++,I'm trying to make a simple game of pong using SDL and OpenGL in C++ and I'm having trouble displaying any sort of OpenGL image onto the screen and was wondering if anybody could help:  Initialization:  void init_everything() { SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING ); SDL_SetVideoMode( width_of_screen height_of_screen bpp_of_screen SDL_OPENGL ); glClearColor( 0 0 0 0 ); // Sets the projection glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION ); glLoadIdentity(); glOrtho( 0 width_of_screen height_of_screen 0 1 -1 ); // initalises the modelview matrix glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); glLoadIdentity(); SDL_WM_SetCaption( Pong - By Michael Clover  NULL ); }  After this I call the class function:  void paddle::show() { //Move to offset glTranslatef( x y 0 ); //Start quad glBegin( GL_QUADS ); //Set color to white glColor4f( 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 ); //Draw square glVertex3f( 0 0 0 ); glVertex3f( paddle_width 0 0 ); glVertex3f( paddle_width paddle_height 0 ); glVertex3f( 0 paddle_height 0 ); //End quad glEnd(); //Reset glLoadIdentity(); }  I then put this in my main function:  int main( int argc char **argv ) { bool quit = false; init_everything(); paddle playerpaddle; while (quit == false ) { while( SDL_PollEvent( &event ) ) { playerpaddle.handle_input(); if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) { quit = true; } } playerpaddle.move(); glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ); playerpaddle.show(); SDL_GL_SwapBuffers(); } clean_up(); return 0; }  All I get is a constant black background screen that I set within a 640 by 480px SDL screen.  Sorry for the huge amount of text and I would be extremely grateful for any insight on what the problem could be here I'm guessing I'm making a silly mistake somewhere.

950314,c++,I have a general Question about inter-thread communication. Right now I am using a bunch of C++ thread (~15). They are all using BusyWait(Polling) each others to get data to process. But it is hard to keep cpu usage low && give good performance and avoiding doing too many context switch. So I am looking at Condition variable and signal. I think I understand the general concept of having on thread going into .Wait() waiting for another thread calling .Signal(). Question #1) My problem might be conceptual but if the thread waiting for a signal get SUSPENDED while waiting it is not able to perform any action by its own. Is there anyway to let it wake up by itself to perform some actions. Question #2) In addition my class are use to pass data in both directions. But if the middle class is waiting for signal from another class it is unable to send signal to that class. Such as:  _________ _________ __________ | Class A |---newData Signal--->| Class B |---newData Signal--->| Class C | | | |(WAITING)|<---newData Signal---| | --------- --------- ----------  So if Class B is on .Wait() for .Signal() from C it is unable to process the new signal from A. Is it possible that both A && C send the same newData signal B to wake it up? Would it be possible to differenciate the signal from A && C. I am coding this using C++ using ACE framework & might switch to Boost. But I guess this is generic enough that I could apply the answer to any OS (hopefully). Thanks
300509,java,From a Java program I need to launch the default browser on a local HTML file pointed to an anchor inside the file. In Java SE 6 the java.awt.Desktop.browse method will open the file but will not honor the anchor so something like the following opens the file at the top but does not page the browser to the anchor: Desktop.getDesktop( file:///C:/foo/bar.html#anchor );  Sun says here http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6477862 that anchors are not supported in the file URI protocol. Does anyone have a better answer? I can use Java SE 6. I would be OK with a Windows only solution.

109762,javascript,I've been playing with Jaxer and while the concept is very cool I cannot figure out how to define objects that are available on both the client and the server. None of the examples I can find define objects at all. I'd like to be able to define an object and specify which methods will be available on the server which will be available on the client and which will be available on the client but executed on the server (server-proxy). Can this be done without using three separate <script> tags with different runat attributes? I would like to be able to define all of my methods in the same js file if possible and it is not practical to define my objects inline in the html with three separate tags... Basically I'd like to be able to do this in one js file: function Person(name) { this.name = name || 'default'; } Person.runat = 'both'; Person.clientStaticMethod = function () { log('client static method'); } Person.clientStaticMethod.runat = 'client'; Person.serverStaticMethod = function() { log('server static method'); } Person.serverStaticMethod.runat = 'server'; Person.proxyStaticMethod = function() { log('proxy static method'); } Person.proxyStaticMethod.runat = 'server-proxy'; Person.prototype.clientMethod = function() { log('client method'); }; Person.prototype.clientMethod.runat = 'client'; Person.prototype.serverMethod = function() { log('server method'); }; Person.prototype.serverMethod.runat = 'server'; Person.prototype.proxyMethod = function() { log('proxy method'); } Person.prototype.proxyMethod.runat = 'server-proxy';  Also assuming I was able to do that how would I include it into html pages correctly?
342392,java,Man this character encoding hole just keeps on getting deeper. Sigh. Ok. Check this out: I have a java String that contains the unicode character U+9996 (that's what I get if I do codePointAt()). If I look at it in the debugger expressions panel (in eclipse) then all is well and it looks like 首 . However if I print it out to the console I get simply ? . It doesn't seem to be the font that's the problem as I've tried setting that differently. My real problem is that I'm trying to put the string into a MySQL database (with utf8 encoding). Lots of other wide characters show up fine in the db but again this one and some others like it show up as ? . All of which leads me to believe that the problem is on the java side. In chasing down this bug I've learnt a little about Unicode Normalization and java.text.Normalizer which looks like it might be relevant in this case. I've learnt that U+9996 is the canonical version of U+2FB8. U+2FB8 has exactly the same problems above though as regards display and anyway why would I want to transform to a non-canonical representation (even if I could which I don't think I can)? Anyway there's one potential clue I've found which I've been unable to comprehend. This page contains the words U+9996 is not a valid unicode character with no further explanation. It then proceeds to show how to encode this supposedly non-valid unicode character in various unicode encodings. So my question is this basically: WTF?  UPDATES  I'm on a Mac. I'm talking about the Eclipse console.  I set the console encoding to UTF-8 under Run > Common I added -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 to the JVM arguments (the default was MacRoman) The console (Eclipse and Terminal.app) now show the right chars. Hooray!  I'm mostly interested in the data getting into the database correctly though of course I'd like to get a total understanding of what's going on here.  I think I've fixed the database problem. I forgot to set the encoding on the connection. Now I don't understand why some asian characters were getting through and not others. Phew stackoverflow moves fast. It's hard to keep up. Thanks people.

Is there any way that I can prevent that call from other classes/methods?

8839211,python,This is the first time I've used ORM so I'm not sure the best way to handle this. I have a one-to-many relationship where each Parent can have many Children: class Parent(Base): __tablename__ = 'Parent' name = Column(String(50)) gid = Column(String(16) primary_key = True) lastUpdate = Column(DateTime) def __init__(selfname gid): self.name = name self.gid = gid self.lastUpdate = datetime.datetime.now() class Child(Base): __tablename__ = 'Child' id = Column(Integer primary_key = True) loc = Column(String(50)) status = Column(String(50)) parent_gid = Column(String(16) ForeignKey('Parent.gid')) parent = relationship( Parent  backref=backref('children'))  Now updates are coming in over the network. When an update comes in I want to UPDATE the appropriate Parent row (updating lastUpdate column) and INSERT new children rows into the database. I don't know how to do that with ORM. Here is my failed attempt: engine = create_engine('sqlite+pysqlite:///file.db' module=dbapi2) Base.metadata.create_all(engine) session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)() def addChildren(parent): p = session.query(Parent).filter(Parent.gid == p1.gid).all() if len(p) == 0: session.add(p1) session.commit() else: updateChildren = parent.children[:] parent.chlidren = [] for c in updateChildren: c.parent_gid = parent.gid session.add_all(updateChildren) session.commit() if __name__ == '__main__': #first update from the 'network' p1 = Parent(name='team1' gid='t1') p1.children = [Child(loc='x' status='a') Child(loc='y' status='b')] addChildren(p1) import time time.sleep(1) #here comes another network update p1 = Parent(name='team1' gid='t1') p1.children = [Child(loc='z' status='a') Child(loc='k' status='b')] #this fails addChildren(p1)  I initially tried to do a merge but that caused the old children to be disassociated with the parent (the foreign IDs were set to null). What is the best way to approach this with ORM? Thanks EDIT I guess it doesn't really make sense to create entirely new objects when updates come in over the network. I should just query the session for the appropriate parent then create new children if necessary and merge? E.g. def addChildren(pname pid cloc cstat): p = session.query(Parent).filter(Parent.gid == pid).all() if len(p) == 0: p = Parent(pname pid) p.children = [Child(loc=cloc status=cstat)] session.add(p) session.commit() else: p = p[0] p.children.append(Child(loc=cloc status=cstat)) session.merge(p) session.commit()

Ideally I'd like to package the code as .jar file and not need an external certificate file (i.e. include it into the code). With this code I can accept all certificates which is not what I want: SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance( TLS ); sc.init(null new TrustManager [] { new MyTrustManager() } new SecureRandom());  Do I need to add the certificate to a custom KeyManager or the custom TrustManager?  One problem I've encountered is that Android does not accept JKS keystores (KeyStore.getDefaultType() returns BKS ): java.security.KeyStoreException: KeyStore JKS implementation not found  Any ideas how to proceed would be highly appreciated!
11448690,python,I trying out Django's class based views (CBVs). class BlahView(TemplateView): template_name = 'blah/blah.html' def get_context_data(self **kwargs): #code... def get(self request **kwargs): #more code...  Now I know that I can get the request params from self.request. Now say I want to parse these request params and store them within the class. Can I store those in self.xxx? Now obviously based on how classes work this seems straightforward. But I can't make out the flow of control looking at the definition of View (superclass of TemplateView). The source mentions as_view() to be the 'entry-point' I thought of setting my instance variables at the beginning of get_context_data() but that doesn't seem right to do initialization there. Can I define an __init__() for my CBV? If so will there be threading issues or something where multiple page-accesses possibly work with a global instance of my parsed data? I know this sounds a bit messy but I'm just a bit confused with the code flow in CBVs.
14925728,javascript,Simple example: I have a textarea and want to provide additional behavior to it: do something on enter key and go to next line on shift + enter I suppose that I should provide additional directive to add that behavior. And I've done this: http://jsbin.com/oruvuy/1/edit P.S. One hackie thing seems strange for me: I invoke $digest() manually. Is it ok? Any thoughts?  JS: angular.module('Chat' []) .directive('enterSubmit' function () { return { restrict: 'A' link: function (scope element attrs) { var submit; $(element).on({ keydown: function (e) { submit = false; if (e.which === 13 && !e.shiftKey) { submit = true; e.preventDefault(); } } keyup: function () { if (submit) { scope.$eval( attrs.enterSubmit ); // flush model changes manually scope.$digest(); } } }); } }; }); function ChatCtrl($scope) { $scope.messages = [{ text: 'Sample Message' datetime: new Date() }]; $scope.add = function () { $scope.messages.push({ text: $scope.message datetime: new Date() }); $scope.message = ''; }; $scope.message = ''; }  <body ng-controller= ChatCtrl > <h1>Leave message:</h1> <form> <div class='hint'>Click &lt;Enter&gt; to submit :)</div> <textarea cols= 30 rows= 5 ng-model= message enter-submit='add()' ></textarea> <br /> <button type= submit ng-click= add() >Send message!</button> </form> <h3>Messages list:</h3> <table> <tr> <th>Text</th> <th>Date</th> </tr> <tr ng-repeat= message in messages > <td class='text'>{{message.text}}</td> <td class='date'>{{message.datetime | date: HH:mm:ss }}</td> </tr> </table> </body>  But is it correct way to do that?

6936842,android,I create an app that supports both phone and tablet version so i use the android-support-v4.jar library. My activity extends the FragmentActivity and override the onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu). This works fine on tablet the onCreateOptionsMenu being called correctly but it doesn't work on phone onCreateOptionsMenu never get called. How to resolve this? Note: i use <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion= 7 android:targetSdkVersion= 12 /> on Manifest file.
25817366,javascript,Someone brought up an interesting case today with bluebird what is the best way to handle multiple promises where we're not interested in stopping on a given fulfillment or rejection but rather interested in inspecting the final result. An example: var p1 = new Promise(function(fr){ setTimeout(function(){ console.log( p1 ); f( yay ); } 100); }); var p2 = new Promise(function(fr){ setTimeout(function(){ console.log( p2 ); r(new Error( boo )); } 200); }) var p3 = new Promise(function(fr){ setTimeout(function(){ console.log( p3 ); r(new Error( yay )); } 300); }); var p4 = new Promise(function(fr){ setTimeout(function(){ console.log( p4 ); f( yay ); } 400); }); //Promise.all([p1p2 p3 p4]).then(function(p){ // console.log( Results: p); //}).error(function(e){ // console.log( Error: e); //}); Promise.map([p1p2 p3 p4]function(p){ console.log( results: p); } {concurrency:10}).error(function(e){ console.log( Error: e); });  Here if we run either map or all the rejected promises will cause handlers not to report results. For example the results of running Promise.map as implemented above is:  debugger listening on port 65222 p1 results: yay p2 Error: [Error: boo] p3 p4 Process finished with exit code 0  Here the code for each promise executes but only 1 result and 1 error is reported. The error causes the process to stop. If we uncomment .all we get similar behavior. This time only the error is reported. Any successes do not make it into then (understandably). debugger listening on port 65313 p1 p2 Error: [Error: boo] p3 p4 Process finished with exit code 0  Given this behavior what would be the best way to go about implementing a scenario where by all promises are run and the results of fulfilled promises are reported with any and all rejections? Something like: Promise.aggregate([p1p2p3p4]).then(function(fulfilled rejected){ console.log(fulfilled); //all success console.log(rejected); //any and all rejections/exceptions }); 
2330569,java,What does this statement Closing a ByteArrayOutputStream has no effect (http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/ByteArrayOutputStream.html#close()) mean? I want to make sure the memory in ByteArrayOutputStream gets released. Does ByteArrayOutputStream.close() really release the memory? Thanks.
15530293,android,My question is more about what is a good practice than what is possible:  Is it a good thing to call NoticationManager.notify() from a worker thread? Does the system execute it in the UI thread anyway or not?  I always try to keep in mind that stuff concerning the UI should be executed in the UI thread and the rest in worker threads as suggested by the Android doc about Processes And Threads:  Additionally the Andoid UI toolkit is not thread-safe. So you must not manipulate your UI from a worker thread—you must do all manipulation to your user interface from the UI thread. Thus there are simply two rules to Android's single thread model:  Do not block the UI thread  Do not access the Android UI toolkit from outside the UI thread   HOWEVER I was surprised by an example given by the Android doc itself (about showing progress in Notifications) where an ongoing notification progress was updated directly from a worker thread: mNotifyManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE); mBuilder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this); mBuilder.setContentTitle( Picture Download ) .setContentText( Download in progress ) .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification); // Start a lengthy operation in a background thread new Thread( new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { int incr; // Do the lengthy operation 20 times for (incr = 0; incr <= 100; incr+=5) { // Sets the progress indicator to a max value the // current completion percentage and determinate // state mBuilder.setProgress(100 incr false); // Displays the progress bar for the first time. mNotifyManager.notify(0 mBuilder.build()); // Sleeps the thread simulating an operation // that takes time try { // Sleep for 5 seconds Thread.sleep(5*1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Log.d(TAG sleep failure ); } } // When the loop is finished updates the notification mBuilder.setContentText( Download complete ) // Removes the progress bar .setProgress(00false); mNotifyManager.notify(ID mBuilder.build()); } } // Starts the thread by calling the run() method in its Runnable ).start();  That's why I'm wondering if it is actually necessary to run it on the main thread or if the system takes care of it. Thanks for your help!
29828334,php,This class is fairly simple it adds a twitter hashtag to a string if there is room for it. Twitter only allows 140 characters (minus 23 for a url). So the hashtags keep getting added if there is space for one.  I don't think it's 100% working as expected but that is not relevant to my question which is located below.  class Hashtags { private $url_character_count = 23; private $characters_allowed = 140; public function __construct(Article $article) { $this->article = $article; $this->characters_remaining = $this->characters_allowed - $this->url_character_count; } public function createHashtagString() { $hashtags = ''; $hashtags .= $this->addEachNodeHashtag(); $hashtags .= $this->addHashtagIfSpace($this->article->topic_hashtag); $hashtags .= $this->addHashtagIfSpace($this->article->pubissue_hashtag); $hashtags .= $this->addHashtagIfSpace($this->article->subject_area_hashtag); $hashtags .= $this->addHashtagIfSpace('#aviation'); return $hashtags; } private function addEachNodeHashtag() { //Returns a hashtag or calls hashtagString() if it is a comma separated list } private function hashtagString() { //Explodes a comma seperated string of hashtags and calls addHashtagIfSpace() } private function addHashtagIfSpace($hashtag_string) { if((strlen($hashtag_string) + 1) <= $this->characters_remaining) { $this->characters_remaining = $this->characters_remaining - strlen($hashtag_string); if(empty($hashtag_string)) { return ''; } return ' ' . $hashtag_string; } }  } Here is my test my problem is that this only tests one specific case where all the fields are filled in and when there is enough space to fit them all. Should I just keep making a bunch of these test functions for different cases? I am guessing there will be about 10 of them. I have never done testing before so I am a bit out of my element and need to to pointed in the correct direction.  Thank you class HashtagsSpec extends ObjectBehavior { function it_creates_hashtag_string_with_all_fields_filled_in(Article $article) { $this->beConstructedWith($article); $article->title = 'This is the article title'; $article->url = 'http://website.com/node/XXX'; $article->pubissue_hashtag = '#AHASHTAG'; $article->subject_area_hashtag = '#SUBAREA'; $article->topic_hashtag = '#TOPIC'; $article->node_hashtags = '#Test1#Test2#Test3'; $this->createHashtagString()->shouldReturn(' #Test1 #Test2 #Test3 #TOPIC #AHASHTAG #SUBAREA #aviation'); } }

7147579,android,I am testing on a Xoom device running OS 3.2. The project is built (in Eclipse) using the 3.1 library. I have the latest version of flash installed and embedded flash plays fine in my tablet's browser. If I create an activity like this: WebView browser = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.browserView); browser .getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); browser .getSettings().setPluginsEnabled(true); browser .loadUrl( http://m.kongregate.com/games/Jiggmin/the-game-of-disorientation-mobile );  Then I hear the sound playing for the flash but it shows up as a white box. Similarly any other page with embedded flash has the same problem. I've also tried making a string containing static HTML content and loading that into the browser... but it has the same problem. I've read every solution I could find online from setting the view to invisible until the onPageFinish event is called to extending the WebView class and paining over it. I've tried reflection to call hidden properties on the WebView's settings for enabling flash etc. Nothing works. Please help! Thanks Mat
11582600,android,For reference: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html The old style size quantifiers are deprecated :  A set of four generalized sizes: small normal large and xlarge Note: Beginning with Android 3.2 (API level 13) these size groups are deprecated in favor of a new technique for managing screen sizes based on the available screen width. If you're developing for Android 3.2 and greater see Declaring Tablet Layouts for Android 3.2 for more information.  I was hoping that devices with 3.2+ would still use resources declared in drawable-large-mdpi or layout-xlarge but this doesn't seem to be the case. I have a test project that contains a layout file for each of these sizes:  layout-sw600dp layout-720dp layout-xlarge layout  On a 10 Motorola XOOM running Android 4.0.x the device picks the layout in the layout-720dp folder. If that folder doesn't exist it picks the layout in the layout-sw600dp folder! Why doesn't it pick the layout in layout-xlarge? Even more strange is I have drawables in these folders:  drawable-sw600dp-mdpi drawable-xlarge-mdpi  The 10 Motorola XOOM from above picks the image from drawable-sw600dp-mdpi. Why doesn't it pick the drawable in drawable-xlarge-mdpi? Should we not expect the xlarge quantifier to work at all above Android 3.2? Does this mean I have to duplicate all assets in the drawable-xlarge-mdpi folder into the drawable-sw720dp-mdpi folder? (To support Android 3.0 3.1 AND 3.2+?) Hopefully I am just missing something simple here. Please advise.

15453709,android,i have nexus s nexus 4 and 6 mifare nfc tags and want to make an desktop application with nfc reader/writer acr122u device (which i haven't bought it yet). But apart from android sdk is there some other SDK needed for making an desktop application through eclipse with java? or i can directly buy and use the acr122u device (without sdk) and make the app through eclipse? If the SDK is needed is there any link to download it for free or i have to buy it from the vendor itself?  One more thing does nexus S and ACR122U support felica nfc cards? I have mifare classic nfc cards its working fine with them.

12160985,c++,I'm in the process of migrating a C++ application from VC++ to GCC (running on Windows using Cygwin). My first problem now is that I cannot build the Boost libraries. For example to build Boost.Exception with VC++ I would write: b2 --with-exception variant=debugrelease link=static runtime-link=static  and I would get the files libboost_exception-vc100-mt-s-1_51.lib and libboost_exception-vc100-mt-sgd-1_51.lib in my stage\lib directory. However when I try the same using GCC form a Cygwin terminal I get errors. I found out that building only debug (or only release) like this works: ./b2 --with-exception variant=debug link=static runtime-link=static  It creates libboost_exception.a in my stage\lib directory for both cases (debug and release). So there seems to be a name conflict (same name for debug and release variant). Is this a bug in the boost build system or am I doing something wrong?  Edit: The output of  ./b2 --with-exception variant=debugrelease link=static runtime-link=static  is:  Building the Boost C++ Libraries. /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/build/virtual-target.jam:1079: in virtual-target.register-actual-name from module virtual-target error: Duplicate name of actual target: libboost_exception.a error: previous virtual target { common%common.copy-libboost_exception.a.STATIC_LIB { gcc%gcc.archive-libboost_exception.a.STATIC_LIB { gcc%gcc.compile.c++-clone_current_exception_non_intrusive.o.OBJ { clone_current_exception_non_intrusive.cpp.CPP } } } } error: created from ./stage-proper error: another virtual target { common%common.copy-libboost_exception.a.STATIC_LIB { gcc%gcc.archive-libboost_exception.a.STATIC_LIB { gcc%gcc.compile.c++-clone_current_exception_non_intrusive.o.OBJ { clone_current_exception_non_intrusive.cpp.CPP } } } } error: created from ./stage-proper error: added properties: off NDEBUG full speed off release error: removed properties: on off off on debug /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/build/virtual-target.jam:490: in actualize-no-scanner from module object(file-target)@1014 /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/build/virtual-target.jam:135: in object(file-target)@1014.actualize from module object(file-target)@1014 /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/build-system.jam:749: in load from module build-system /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/kernel/modules.jam:283: in import from module modules /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/tools/build/v2/kernel/bootstrap.jam:142: in boost-build from module /cygdrive/c/boost_1_51_0/boost-build.jam:17: in module scope from module 
14564155,javascript,I'm creating two objects (Inherits) both inherit from Base. The second object's property assignment overrides the value in the first object. Any thoughts? How to make a proper inheritance so that Base class will contain common members for its inheritance descendants but the descendants could assign values of their own without interfering each other. var testParams1 = { title: john }; var testParams2 = { title: mike }; Function.prototype.inheritsFrom = function (baseClass) { this.prototype = new baseClass; this.prototype.constructor = this; this.prototype.base = baseClass.prototype; return this; }; function Base() { this.viewModel = {}; this.viewModel.title = (function () { var savedVal = ; return function (newVal) { if (typeof (newVal) === undefined ) { return savedVal; } savedVal = newVal; }; })(); } function Inherits(params) { this.viewModel.title(params.title); } Inherits.inheritsFrom(Base); ///// preparing code: var testObj1 = new Inherits(testParams1); var testObj2 = new Inherits(testParams2); ///// testing code: equals(testObj1.viewModel.title() testParams1.title first instance ok ); // returns john equals(testObj2.viewModel.title() testParams2.title second instance ok ); // also returns john 
10262498,javascript,I need to render a model's attributes to JSON so I can pass them into a template. Here is what a render() function for a view looks like: render: function() { console.log(this.model); console.log(this.model.toJSON()); $(this.el).html(this.template(this.model.toJSON())); return this; }  Here is the attributes output after doing console.log(this.model): created_at: 2012-04-19 id: 29 name: item resource_uri: /api/v1/item/29/ updated_at: 2012-04-21 user: /api/v1/user/9/  Here is the model's JSON output after doing console.log(this.model.toJSON()): id: 29 __proto__: Object  What happened? Edit: Here is the instantiation:  var goal = new Goal({id: id}); goal.fetch(); var goalFullView = new GoalFullView({ model: goal });  Here are the contents of the new view:  console.log(this.model.attributes); console.log(this.model.toJSON());  Here is what the console says: Object created_at: 2012-04-23 id: 32 name: test resource_uri: /api/v1/goal/32/ updated_at: 2012-04-23 user: /api/v1/user/9/ __proto__: Object Object id: 32 name: test __proto__: Object  If the toJSON is supposed to make a clone of the attributes why doesn't it copy the correct name or why doesn't it copy the created_at updated_at fields? Edit 2: Here is the model:  var Goal = Backbone.Model.extend({ // Default attributes for Goal defaults: { name: empty goal  } // Check that the user entered a goal validate: function(attrs) { if (!attrs.name) { return name is blank ; } } // Do HTTP requests on this endpoint url: function() { if (this.isNew()) { return API_URL + goal/ + this.get( id ) + FORMAT_JSON; } return API_URL + goal/ + FORMAT_JSON; //API_URL + goal + FORMAT_JSON } });  Edit 3: I figured out that I need to use the success callback from fetch to render a view that uses the model: goal.fetch({success: function(model) { var goalFullView = new GoalFullView({ model: goal }); }});
28284989,ios,I am developing an iPhone app with a Today Extension. The app has a Model module that loads from/saves to NSUserDefaults. Since I want this information to be available to both the main app and the extension I use an app group: let storage = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: group.etc.etc.etc... )  Both the app and the extension can access the information without any problem. The main app ocasionally might create a local notification to present to the user. That notification has two actions associated with it (UIUserNotificationAction). One of those actions triggers some code run on the background on the main app. That code changes the NSUserDefaults information and triggers a synchronization. My code is something like this: func application(application: UIApplication handleActionWithIdentifier id: String? forLocalNotification not: UILocalNotification completionHandler: () -> ()) { // Interact with model here // New information gets saved to NSUserDefaults userDefaultsStorage.synchronize() completionHandler() }  Now on the Today Ext. I naturally observe any changes made to the information on NSUserDefaults so that I can reload the interface on the widget: override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // ... NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification object: nil queue: NSOperationQueue.mainQueue()) { _ in self.reload() } }  Now here's my issue:  The main app schedules a UILocalNotification. I open the today view and look at my today widget. When the notification fires a banner appears on the top of the screen. I slide down on that banner to reveal the two actions and I select the one that I mentioned earlier (the today widget is still live and on screen).  I know for a fact that the action runs correctly in the background and that the changes are being made to the information on NSUserDefaults. However even though the today widget has been active and on screen all this time no reload action is triggered. After further investigation I can confirm that the NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification is not being fired (I placed a breakpoint and it did not trigger and did some other checks as well). I know the changes are being made by the notification action because if I force a reload of the widget (by closing and opening the today view) the widget updates correctly. I have seen various tutorials online where the first thing they say is to listen to this notification and update the widget so that the widget is in sync with NSUserDefaults . But the thing is that AFAICT this notification is absolutely useless! How come??  Note 1: When I change the information on NSUserDefaults from within the today widget the notification fires correctly. Note 2: Debugging a today widget is absolutely horrible btw. It is always necessary to tell Xcode to Attach to process by name... before it can react to breakpoints and crashes. And iOS is constantly creating a new process for the widget so I have to constantly tell Xcode to attach again.

29480569,javascript,I was surprised that I couldn't find anything about abstract classes when reading up on ES6. (By abstract class I'm talking about the Java meaning of it in which an abstract class declares method signatures that a subclass must implement in order to be instantiable). Does anyone know of any conventions that have taken hold to implement abstract classes in ES6? It would be nice to be able to catch an abstract class violation with static analysis. If I were to raise an error at runtime to signal an attempt at abstract class instantiation what would the error be?

13407194,ios,I have setup a uitableview with custom cells.  I would like these into sections with a title. Looking at the below photo I am looking for the following layout: Section - My Profile Custom cell - wwwwwwwwwwwwww... Section - Application Custom cell - Games Custom cell - Share Custom cell - Rate Custom cell - Settings Custom cell - Help  Custom cell - Log out I can see how to add a section and control the rows in a section but this duplicates the cells into multiple sections I am not sure how to have one section with one row and another section with 6 rows. I also want to style these sections to show slightly like the Facebook menu style.  Should I create custom cells for the actual sections instead and have no action on the section (cell) selection? Here is the code for the UITableView static NSString *CellIdentifier = @ Cell ; LeftMenuTableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier]; if (cell == nil) { NSArray* views = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@ LeftMenuTableViewCell owner:nil options:nil]; for (UIView *view in views) { if([view isKindOfClass:[UITableViewCell class]]) { cell = (LeftMenuTableViewCell*)view; } } }  
13556476,ios,When using a UICollectionView with allowsMultipleSelection set to YES only a dozen items are selectable. UICollectionViewDelegate stops calling collectionView:didSelectItemAtIndexPath:. It seems very random. You can select a few items scroll down select some more and at some point you're not able to select any more items. When the cell is smaller you seem to be able to select more items. The larger the cell the fewer items you're able to select before it stops working.
2148523,jquery,I am trying to figure out the most efficient way to find my element. Following i smy structure: <div class= a customattrib= 2 >  in order to find this element can I do something like : $( div.a [customattrib='2'] )  This does not seem to work is there another way to do this? Without the class I am able to get the value but I do not think this is efficient enough for my structure: $( div [customattrib='2'] )

9726172,javascript,I have a view model with an observableArray (named 'all') of objects. One of the properties of that object is an observable name selected. I want some code to execute whenever the selected property of the of the child object in the array changes. I tried manually subscribing to all via all.subscribe() but that code only fires when items are added or removed. I updated the code to do it like this: all.subscribe(function () { ko.utils.arrayForEach(all() function (item) { item.selected.subscribe(function () { //code to fire when selected changes }); }); });  Is this the right way to do this or is there a better way?

Maybe my code is wrong (it's my first approach of cryptography in Java i'm not an expert and the following code is mostly some copy-pastes of tutorials). I use this code to crypt and decrypt a String : public String cryptString(String s) throws NoSuchPaddingException NoSuchAlgorithmException InvalidKeyException UnsupportedEncodingException BadPaddingException IllegalBlockSizeException { byte[] KeyData = this.cryptKey.getBytes(); SecretKeySpec KS = new SecretKeySpec(KeyData Blowfish ); Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance( Blowfish ); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE KS); String ret = new String(cipher.doFinal(s.getBytes( UTF-8 ))); return ret; } public String decryptString(byte[] s) throws NoSuchPaddingException NoSuchAlgorithmException InvalidKeyException BadPaddingException IllegalBlockSizeException { byte[] KeyData = this.cryptKey.getBytes(); SecretKeySpec KS = new SecretKeySpec(KeyData Blowfish ); Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance( Blowfish ); cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE KS); String ret = new String(cipher.doFinal(s)); return ret; }  And the following key : private String cryptKey = qkjll5@2md3gs5Q@FDFqf ;  Thank you guys.
19717135,java,I am new to IntelliJ IDE i have a requirement that i need to create a sample code template inmy project so that everybody in the team can also kind of import it in their IDEs and use it. I am able to do it on my own machine by changing the class template myself but i just don't have any way to make it available to my team like exporting it to a file that can be used in Eclipse it is possible to have one sampleCodeFormatter.xml file that everybody can import in their eclipse workspace. How does the same thing works in IntelliJ IDEA?  Any help will be appreciated!!

Which one should I use for a dektop Java app? Or maybe there is another one that is really good and I have no idea it exists?

15631653,ios,I am NOT using navigation controller and I am using storyboards.  I have to make a transition from 1 view controller to other for which I am using segue. Now I set the segue style to Custom and in the corresponding class I override the perform method.  -(void)perform { UIViewController *sourceViewController = [self sourceViewController]; UIViewController *destinationViewController = [self destinationViewController]; CATransition *transition = [CATransition animation]; transition.duration = 0.25; transition.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseIn]; transition.type = kCATransitionPush; transition.subtype = kCATransitionFromLeft; [sourceViewController.view.layer addAnimation:transition forKey:kCATransition];animated:NO]; [sourceViewController presentViewController:destinationViewController animated:YES completion:nil]; }  But there is also a property of the destination view controller modalTransitionStyle. So Right now the source VC goes from left to right as if it is being pushed but I want to show that it is being pushed by the destination view controller. Instead the destination VC does a 'Cover Vertical' by default and there are only four options available for the modalTransitionStyle property none of which is working for me. I think to make it work this animation should be added to some superview layer a superview from which both view controllers have been presented. But there is no such superview..

13748674,python,I am doing some text normalization using python and regular expressions. I would like to substitute all 'u'or 'U's with 'you'. Here is what I have done so far: import re text = 'how are u? umberella u! u. U. U@ U# u ' print re.sub (' [u|U][s.?!W#@ (^a-zA-Z)]' ' you ' text)  The output I get is: how are you you berella you you you you you you  As you can see the problem is that 'umberella' is changed to 'berella'. Also I want to keep the character that appears after a 'u'. For example I want 'u!' to be changed to 'you!'. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong and what is the best way to write the regular expression? 
1677848,jquery,I find drag-and-drop difficult (you know keeping the mouse button depressed while moving) and want to offer a 'select and drop' where a user clicks on an icon and clicks again on the drawing-plate to drop the corresponding element (a picture). How do you do that with jquery? Thanks. Edit: I have two divs an icons plate to select elements from and a drawing plate where pictures are dropped. When the mouse enters the drawing plate I want a 50% opacity of the bigger image follow the mouse pointer so that the user knows by clicking where it is going to be dropped and if it overlaps with anything already on the drawing board.
3342216,c++|python,I have a library which creates objects (instances of class A) and pass them to a python program which should be able to call their methods. Basically I have C++ class instances and I want to use them from python. Occasionally that object should be passed back to C++ for some manipulations. I created the following wrapper file (let's assume that the New function is called somewhere in the C++ code): #include <boost/python.hpp> #include <iostream> #include <boost/smart_ptr.hpp> using namespace boost; using namespace boost::python; int calls = 0; struct A { int f() { return calls++; } ~A() { std::cout << destroyed\n ; } }; shared_ptr<A> existing_instance; void New() { existing_instance = shared_ptr<A>( new A() ); } int Count( shared_ptr<A> a ) { return a.use_count(); } BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(libp) { class_<A>( A ) .def( f  &A::f) ; def( Count  &Count); register_ptr_to_python< shared_ptr<A> >(); }  The code lacks the part where the python gets the existing_instance. I didn't paste that but let's just say I use a callback mechanism for that purpose. This code works but I have a few questions:  In the Count function (and in all other C++ manipulation functions) is it fine to pass a like that or it's better to do something like const shared_ptr<A>&? In the code snippets I found in the python boost documentation the reference is often used but I don't understand the difference (apart from having a higher reference counter of course). Is this code safe ? When I pass the existing_instance to python its counter will be incremented (just once even if in python I make more copies of the object of course) so there is no way that the C++ code could destroy the object as far as python holds at least a copy . Am I correct? I tried to play with pointers and it seems I'm correct I'm asking just to be sure. I'd like to prevent python from creating instances of A. They should only be passed from C++ code. How could I achieve that? EDIT: found I just need to use no_init and noncopyable: class_<A boost::noncopyable>( A  no_init) 
4573186,php,I want to program a HTTP WebChat using long-held HTTP requests (Comet) ajax and websockets (depending on the browser used). Userdatabase is in mysql. Chat is written in PHP except maybe the chat stream itself which could also be written in javascript (node.js): I don't want to start a php process per user as there is no good way to send the chat messages between these php childs. So I thought about writing an own socket server in either PHP or node.js which should be able to handle more then 1000 connections (chat users). As a purely web developer (php) I'm not much familiar with sockets as I usually let web server care about connections. The chat messages won't be saved on disk nor in mysql but in RAM as an array or object for best speed. As far as I know there is no way to handle multiple connections at the same time in a single php process (socket server) however you can accept a great amount of socket connections and process them successive in a loop (read and write; incoming message -> write to all socket connections). The problem is that there will most-likely be a lag with ~1000 users and mysql operations could slow the whole thing down which will then affect all users. My question is: Can node.js handle a socket server with better performance? Node.js is event-based but I'm not sure if it can process multiple events at the same time (wouldn't that need multi-threading?) or if there is just an event queue. With an event queue it would be just like php: process user after user. I could also spawn a php process per chat room (much less users) but afaik there are singlethreaded IRC servers which are also capable to handle thousands of users. (written in c++ or whatever) so maybe it's also possible in php. I would prefer PHP over Node.js because then the project would be php-only and not a mixture of programming languages. However if Node can process connections simultaneously I'd probably choose it.

2044616,javascript,I was wondering if anybody knows how to select using js the complete table so that the user can right-click on the selection copy it to the clipboard and then paste it on excel. If you select the table manually the process works perfectly. But sometimes if the table height is a few times larger than the screen selecting it dragging the mouse gets tedious. So I want to give the users the posibility to click on a select the whole table button and everything gets ready to be copied.  Any ideas?
4233476,python,I have a list of lists (which could have been tuples but I digress) in a format such as: [12 'tall' 'blue' 1] [15 'tall' 'black' 3] [13 'tall' 'blue' 8] [9 'short' 'blue' 3] [1 'short' 'black' 2] [2 'short' 'red' 9] [4 'tall' 'blue' 13]  If I wanted to sort by one element say the tall/short element I could do it via s = sorted(s key = itemgetter(1)) If I wanted to sort by BOTH tall/short and colour I could do the sort twice. Once for each element. However this is computationally ridiculous. Is there a quicker way?
10025114,javascript,I'm trying to understand how JS is actually parsed. But my searches either return some ones very vaguely documented project of a parser/generator (i don't even know what that means) or how to parse JS using a JS Engine using the magical parse method. I don't want to scan through a bunch of code and try all my life to understand (although i can it would take too long).  i want to know how an arbitrary string of JS code is actually turned into objects functions variables etc. I also want to know the procedures and techniques that turns that string into stuff gets stored referenced executed. Are there any documentation/references for this?

16983843,python,I have a large 3d np.ndarray of data that represents a physical variable sampled over a volume in a regular grid fashion (as in the value in array[000] represents the value at physical coords (000)).  I would like to go to a finer grid spacing by interpolating the data in the rough grid. At the moment I'm using scipy griddata linear interpolation but it's pretty slow (~90secs for 20x20x20 array). It's a bit overengineered for my purposes allowing random sampling of the volume data. Is there anything out there that can take advantage of my regularly spaced data and the fact that there is only a limited set of specific points I want to interpolate to? 
17219917,java,I found it very difficult to do password recovery since I've never done it before. So far I have web app which has: Spring Security where password is properly hashed and user roles implemented and work correctly. The strategy hints research from stackoverflow:  User hits forgot-password button where he enters his email address. Dynamic link is sent to email address User opens link in email address Which redirects him to password reset page  What is not known:  How to give link dynamic nature - methods of generations Link has a timeout - some questions were found here but often involve custom handler or extension to spring security functionality A request mapping methods to respond to such dynamic link Temporary link storage methods - database session etc. ?  As you can see the list is quite severe for a single question. So was hoping you might be able to provide guide resources to how to do it step by step. I was a little surprised I could not find much on this in Spring Security documentation. Thanks. I am student so don't know really industry best practices for doing so especially in the context of Java so I really hope anyone will be able to help.

12899372,java,Example interface IA { public void someFunction(); } @Resource(name= b ) class B implements IA { public void someFunction() { //busy code block } public void someBfunc() { //doing b things } } @Resource(name= c ) class C implements IA { public void someFunction() { //busy code block } public void someCfunc() { //doing C things } } class MyRunner { @Autowire @Qualifier( b ) IA worker; worker.someFunction(); }  Can someone explain this to me.   How does spring know which polymorphic type to use.  Do I need @Qualifier or @Resource?  Why do we autowire the interface and not the implemented class? 
14436641,android,I don't understand how the layer-lists work. I read the official documentation with some examples but it does not work for me like expected. I want four squares which should be padded with 1dp but nothing is like expected. Here is a screenshot scaled by 500%:  (The wrong colors do not matter) As you can see the size is completely wrong and the paddings are missing. I tried to set real values like width/height and right/left/top/buttom to be sure that android get the point what I want. Here is my xml: <?xml version= 1.0 encoding= utf-8 ?> <layer-list xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android > <item android:top= 0dp android:left= 0dp android:bottom= 0dp android:right= 0dp > <shape android:shape= rectangle > <size android:width= 9dp android:height= 9dp /> <solid android:color= #f000 /> </shape> </item> <item android:top= 1dp android:left= 1dp android:bottom= 5dp android:right= 5dp > <shape android:shape= rectangle > <size android:width= 3dp android:height= 3dp /> <solid android:color= #f00 /> </shape> </item> <item android:top= 1dp android:left= 5dp android:bottom= 5dp android:right= 1dp > <shape android:shape= rectangle > <size android:width= 3dp android:height= 3dp /> <solid android:color= #0f0 /> </shape> </item> <item android:top= 5dp android:left= 1dp android:bottom= 1dp android:right= 5dp > <shape android:shape= rectangle > <size android:width= 3dp android:height= 3dp /> <solid android:color= #0f0 /> </shape> </item> <item android:top= 5dp android:left= 5dp android:bottom= 1dp android:right= 1dp > <shape android:shape= rectangle > <size android:width= 3dp android:height= 3dp /> <solid android:color= #f00 /> </shape> </item> </layer-list>

21868684,python,The problem I worked on some python projects lately and had lots of problems with pip not installing the latest versions of some requirements. I am on osx and and I used brew to install Python 2.7.6. In the project I'm working on we simply pip install -r requirements.txt. In the current case I needed to install argparse==1.2.1. This is the actual latest version shown on the pypi website Here's my output Downloading/unpacking argparse==1.2.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 4)) Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement argparse==1.2.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 4)) (from versions: 0.1.0 0.2.0 0.3.0 0.4.0 0.5.0 0.6.0 0.7.0 0.8.0 0.9.0 0.9.1 1.0.1 1.0 1.1) Some externally hosted files were ignored (use --allow-external to allow). Cleaning up... No distributions matching the version for argparse==1.2.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 4))  I had similar problems with different kinds of requirements such as matplotlib which I installed manually as seen here. As you can see pip on my mac only has those argparse versions: 0.1.0 0.2.0 0.3.0 0.4.0 0.5.0 0.6.0 0.7.0 0.8.0 0.9.0 0.9.1 1.0.1 1.0 1.1 Attempts to fix I tried reinstalling python with brew reinstall python then also tried to reinstall all of my installed python packages with some xargs magic: pip freeze | xargs -I {} sudo pip install {} --upgrade --force-reinstall. While trying to reinstall everything I had trouble with most of the packages: error: invalid command 'egg_info'. I figured out I had an old setuptools so I pip install --upgrade setuptools and I could now reinstall everything but still same problem with argparse. Still the same problem with argparse. I asked a friend with a freshly installed osx to pip install argparse and he got 1.1 So I've setup a precise32 vagrant box for a clean ubuntu install with python-dev + libevent-dev and had no trouble at all installing argparse==1.2.1. Temp fix To continue working on the project I installed argparse 1.1 on osx and it seems to work fine atm for what I'm working on. Questions I'm not very good with pypi (yet) but is-there any reason why I'm not getting the latest versions shown on pypi? Sounds like not all the libs on pypi are available for osx. Is there a way to know version availability for different os? Edit: solution inside argparse 1.1 seems to be the same as 1.2.1 as shown on this output vagrant@precise32:~$ python Python 2.7.3 (default Sep 26 2013 20:08:41) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type help  copyright  credits or license for more information. >>> import argparse >>> argparse.__version__ '1.1' >>> quit() vagrant@precise32:~$ pip freeze | grep argparse argparse==1.2.1  I tried to use --allow-external on osx but did not realize it needed the name of the package again.  sudo pip install argparse --allow-external argparse --upgrade  and voilà :) argparse an externally hosted file and may be unreliable Downloading/unpacking argparse from http://argparse.googlecode.com/files/argparse-1.2.1.tar.gz#md5=2fbef8cb61e506c706957ab6e135840c Downloading argparse-1.2.1.tar.gz (69kB): 69kB downloaded  As pointed out by Peter latest version of pip default to disallowing externally hosted files.

13692812,javascript,Is it better to stay with the basic Javascript language or will Dart save me a lot of time? I think Dart looks like very cool software but will it increase my production? Is Dart code faster than javascript?  Is it a good way to go or is it still unclear whether to choose to learn it? My goal is to make very good animated websites with some complex custom transitions. I do well with jQuery but i want to be more specific and professional than using jQuery plugins and tweak it.  Thank you very much for your help and advice.

17959170,android,Is there anyway to use DatePicker widget with other calendar systems ? I need a picker for Jalali (Persian) Calendar system but i dont know how to feed DatePicker with my data. I've studied methods related to DatePicker but couldn't find anything that allows me to do that. I also found a custom widget called android-wheel its a iOS-styled widget and does not feel native but it allows me to implement this. so is there anyway to have a native-looking DatePicker widget that allows me to pick date for Jalali Calendar system and have month names in persian ? UPDATE: I've previously answered my question and it solves the problem But @Mohamad Amin has created a great library for that and i strongly advise you to use his library (Thanks Mohamad Amin).
6620374,java,I'm using Cloudera's Hadoop distribution CDH-0.20.2CDH3u0. Is there any way I could the information such as jobtracker status tasktracker status counters using a JAVA program running outside of hadoop framework? I tried listening using JMX but hadoop provides very less information regarding Jobtracker tasktracker and datanode. It doesn't provide any JMX attributes related to running job state like map percent completion reduce percent completion task percent completion attempt percent completion counters status etc. Futhermore I tried using the metrics logs dumped by hadoop. But it too doesn't contain any information regarding map/reduce percent completion task percent completion. I think there should be some alternative way to get all those stuffs. Please do reply.
5154197,python,Sorry if this has been asked before. Is it possible to create class in Python dynamically where attributes is not defined in the __init__ method of the class. For example with this class class Person(object): def __init__(self): ...  I can dynamically put in the attributes during initialization like this: person = Person(name='Joe') and access it like this: person.name >>> Joe  Thank you
5525561,php,I'm fairly new to JSON and I'm trying to get the latitude and longitude of a geocoded city from the Google Maps API using curl. The function I'm using is: function geocode($city){ $cityclean = str_replace (  +  $city); $details_url = http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address= . $cityclean . &sensor=false ; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_URL $details_url); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER 1); $geoloc = json_decode(curl_exec($ch) true); $step1 = $geoloc['results']; $step2 = $step1['geometry']; $coords = $step2['location']; print $coords['lat']; print $coords['lng']; }  The goal of all of that is to pull the lat and lng values from the Results -> Geometry -> Location array of the following JSON: { status : OK  results : [ { types : [ locality  political ] formatted_address : Westminster London UK  address_components : [ { long_name : London  short_name : London  types : [ locality  political ] } { long_name : Westminster  short_name : Westminster  types : [ administrative_area_level_3  political ] } { long_name : Greater London  short_name : Greater London  types : [ administrative_area_level_2  political ] } { long_name : England  short_name : England  types : [ administrative_area_level_1  political ] } { long_name : United Kingdom  short_name : GB  types : [ country  political ] } ] geometry : { location : { lat : 51.5001524 lng : -0.1262362 } location_type : APPROXIMATE  viewport : { southwest : { lat : 51.3493528 lng : -0.3783580 } northeast : { lat : 51.7040647 lng : 0.1502295 } } bounds : { southwest : { lat : 51.3493528 lng : -0.3783580 } northeast : { lat : 51.7040647 lng : 0.1502295 } } } } ] }  However it doesn't print anything. I know that the function successfully retrieves the JSON from Google and brings it to my server as I did a print statement for the 'status' value and it returned 'OK'. The problem seems to be when I try and delve deeper into the JSON. Sorry if it's a straightforward problem but like I said I'm new to this and it's driving me crazy now. Thanks a lot! :)

13839850,java,I'm trying to use Xuggler (which I believe uses ffmpeg under the hood) to do the following:  Accept a raw MPJPEG video bitstream (from a small TTL serial camera) and encode/transcode it to h.264; and Accept a raw audio bitsream (from a microphone) and encode it to AAC; then Mux the two (audio and video) bitsreams together into a MPEG-TS container  I've watched/read some of their excellent tutorials and so far here's what I've got: // I'll worry about implementing this functionality later but // involves querying native device drivers. byte[] nextMjpeg = getNextMjpegFromSerialPort(); // I'll also worry about implementing this functionality as well; // I'm simply providing these for thoroughness. BufferedImage mjpeg = MjpegFactory.newMjpeg(nextMjpeg); // Specify a h.264 video stream (how?) String h264Stream = ??? ; IMediaWriter writer = ToolFactory.makeWriter(h264Stream); writer.addVideoStream(0 0 ICodec.ID.CODEC_ID_H264); writer.encodeVideo(0 mjpeg);  For one I think I'm close here but it's still not correct; and I've only gotten this far by reading the video code examples (not the audio - I can't find any good audio examples). Literally I'll be getting byte-level access to the raw video and audio feeds coming into my Xuggler implementation. But for the life of me I can't figure out how to get them into an h.264/AAC/MPEG-TS format. Thanks in advance for any help here.
20362493,java,I know if we know the annotation class we can easily get the specific annotation and access it's attribute. For example: field.getAnnotation(Class<T> annotationClass)  Which will return a reference of specific annotation interface so you can easily access it's values. My question is if I have no pre knowledge about the particular annotations class. I just want to use reflection to get all the annotation class name and their attributes at run-time for the purpose of dumping the class information for example as json file. How can I do it in a easy way. Annotation[] field.getAnnotations();  This method will only return dynamic proxies of the annotation interfaces.
22806784,java,I have an interface: public static interface Consumer<T> { void consume(T t); }  And I want to be able to have: public static class Foo implements Consumer<String> Consumer<Integer> { public void consume(String t) {..} public void consume(Integer i) {..} }  It doesn't work - the compiler doesn't let you implement the same interface twice. The question is: Why? People have asked similar questions here but the answer was always type erasure  i.e. you cannot do it because the types are erased at runtime. And they aren't - some types are retained at runtime. And they are retained in this particular case: public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { ParameterizedType type = (ParameterizedType) Foo.class.getGenericInterfaces()[0]; System.out.println(type.getActualTypeArguments()[0]); }  This prints class java.lang.String (if I only keep Consumer<String> in order to compile) So erasure in its simplest explanation is not the reason or at least it needs elaboration - the type is there and also you don't care about the type resolution because you already have two methods with distinct signature. Or at least it seems so.
7575166,android, Possible Duplicate: Get generated id after insert   I want to get the last inserted row id in my android application using this code : String query = SELECT * from SQLITE_SEQUENCE ; int createdUserId = Integer.parseInt(dbHelper.executeSQLQuery(query).toString());  but the problem is that it's throws an exception that cannot convert dbHelper.executeSQLQuery(query).toString() to integer. I'm not really good at sqlite but i think that this should return the last row id which was inserted...which will definitely will be int (at least I think this way). So if this is not the right way can someone please guide me how to get the last row id in android application. Thanks!!!

778965,python,I'm working on an application that lets registered users create or upload content and allows anonymous users to view that content and browse registered users' pages to find that content - this is very similar to how a site like Flickr for example allows people to browse its users' pages. To do this I need a way to identify the user in the anonymous HTTP GET request. A user should be able to type http://myapplication.com/browse/<userid>/<contentid> and get to the right page - should be unique but mustn't be something like the user's email address for privacy reasons.  Through Google App Engine I can get the email address associated with the user but like I said I don't want to use that. I can have users of my application pick a unique user name when they register but I would like to make that optional if at all possible so that the registration process is as short as possible.  Another option is to generate some random cookie (a GUID?) during the registration process and use that I don't see an obvious way of guaranteeing uniqueness of such a cookie without a trip to the database. Is there a way given an App Engine user object of getting a unique identifier for that object that can be used in this way?  I'm looking for a Python solution - I forgot that GAE also supports Java now. Still I expect the techniques to be similar regardless of the language.
1694828,java,I have a project for school and I have to use Java. Recently I found play framework and I want to try to use it. It's easy enough for a quick start but I ran into a problem with session. Being stateless by its nature play sends entire session to user in cookie and receives it on next request so it allows only limited amount of data in session. What I want to do is to fetch User object from DB on user login and keep it in session so I could access it from templates and so on (I have some methods in User class that I need to call in order to customize UI) but if I put User object play calls its toString method and puts that in session. I found that recommended way is to put larger amount of data into Cache but I don't know how to access it from template (I guess I could make method with @Before annotation and add user to renderArgs but that does not seem very clean to me). Another problem is that Cache has limited lifetime so my object can disappear. Does anyone has experience with this kind of problems? Is there any way to use server side session with play? I don't need REST functionality for this project so as far as I am concerned application can save state... 
9717268,ios,The structure of a .mobileprovision file looks something like this: <!-- small binary data --> <?xml version= 1.0 encoding= UTF-8 ?> <!-- plist data --> </plist> <!-- large binary data -->  I have a few questions around this:  What is this binary data?

11589816,jquery,Is it possible to implement vertical carousel sliding widh Twitter Bootstrap? In bootstrap.js I find this   slide: function (type next) { var $active = this.$element.find('.active')  $next = next || $active[type]()  isCycling = this.interval  direction = type == 'next' ? 'left' : 'right'  fallback = type == 'next' ? 'first' : 'last'  that = this  I tried to change direction to up and down but sliding not working.
17595546,android,I have found many posts on stackoverflow but I still cannot solve my problem. Here is my code piece: public class MyView extends RelativeLayout { Button b1; Button b2; Context sContext; public static int i = 0; private int w = 400; private int h = 400; private int w2 = 100; private int h2 = 100; public MyView(Context context) { super(context); sContext = context; init(); } public MyView(Context context AttributeSet attrs) { super(context attrs); sContext = context; init(); } private void init() { b1 = new Button(sContext); addView(b1); b1.setBackgroundColor(Color.YELLOW); b1.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { if (w >= 600) { MyView.this.setBackgroundColor(Color.GREEN); //b1.setBackgroundColor(Color.RED); } else { MyView.this.setX(100); } MyView.this.invalidate(); w += 100; w2 += 20; } }); } @Override protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) { super.onDraw(canvas); //b1.setBackgroundColor(Color.RED); Toast.makeText(sContext +i Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); ++i; } }  Would you please explain why onDraw is not called the first three times I press b1? Because I called invalidate everytime I press b1. Thank you very much!
12827408,jquery,I am confused about the various behaviors of keypress keydown and keyup. It seems that I have missed an important piece of documentation one that explains the subtleties and nuances of this trio. Could someone help me to figure out which document I need to read in order to more effectively use these events? In case you want details see below. @o.v.: you asked me to show some code but it's not really a specific problem in the code that I'm trying to solve. I'm trying to get a handle on the behaviors of these event handlers and asking someone who understands them to point me to a good piece of documentation. I use jQuery to build an input form and insert it into my document. It works just fine mostly. I want the form to respond to the keyboard like most other input forms I see out there: the esc key should dismiss the form the same as clicking the cancel button and because the form has a <textarea> on it cmd+enter should be the same as clicking the ok button. It seems simple enough to use the keypress event. The problem is that Chrome doesn't call my keypress handler for the esc key or cmd+enter. It fires for ctrl+enter and option+enter and for alphanumerics but not cmd+enter. So I'll use keyup instead. I get keyup for esc and keyup for cmd and keyup for enter great. But I don't get keyup for the enter key while I'm holding down cmd. Third time's the charm you might think. keydown seems to work but with keydown you get repeat keys. I know all you have to do is unbind the handler the first time you're called but it just seems weird that the three different event types would behave so differently. Why is this? Is there an obvious document out there that I obviously haven't read?
7838853,javascript|html,In the KnockoutJS tutorials I stumbled upon the following code example that contains an unexplainable variable $data.  The View (html): <!-- Folders --> <ul class= folders data-bind= template: { name: 'folderTemplate' foreach: folders } ></ul> <script type= text/html id= folderTemplate > <li data-bind= css: { selected: $data == mailViewModel.selectedFolder() } click: function() { mailViewModel.selectFolder($data) } > ${$data} </li> </script>  The View Model (JavaScript): var viewModel = { // Data folders: ['Inbox' 'Archive' 'Sent' 'Spam'] selectedFolder: ko.observable('Inbox') // Behaviours selectFolder: function (folder) { this.selectedFolder(folder); } }; window.mailViewModel = viewModel; ko.applyBindings(viewModel);  The tutorial does not contain any explanation what that dollar sign is used for and where this $data comes from. The variable $data is nowhere defined and when I rename all three instances of $data to $foobar the example does not work anymore.  What kind of magic is going on here?
4916361,python,I was approached by a friend a few days ago - who has very little programming experience and he has a project that he asked for some help with. Basically - this is what he is attempting to accomplish: 1.) Create a website that can accept text files as input. 2.) Read said file and pass the parameters contained in the file to a python script. 3.) Output these results of the script on the same webpage upon completion.  He knows a small amount of Python (enough to write the processing script) but he has no idea where to go from here. I made a quick example for him using an ASP page that read in a file and used IronPython to pass the parameters into a script file and output the results which worked just as I had expected it. However - for him I was hoping to guide him in the right direction of developing a much simpler application to perform this and was hoping to find some suggestions or hear some thoughts on different approaches. I figure due to his lack of experience the simpler the better. Thanks guys.
8073098,ios,So I'm using ARC in my project and when I add an AVPlayerLayer it works just fine and dandy but when I pop the UIViewController from my UINavigationItem the video continues to play in the background. Does anyone know how you would handle this? It seems like something easy I'm just overlooking. Here's the code I have for the initially instantiations. self.currentItem = [[AVPlayerItem alloc] initWithURL:url]; self.player = [[AVPlayer alloc]initWithPlayerItem:self.currentItem]; self.avPlayerLayer = [AVPlayerLayer playerLayerWithPlayer:player]; self.avPlayerLayer.bounds = self.view.bounds; self.avPlayerLayer.frame = CGRectMake(055 1024 670); self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]; [self.view.layer addSublayer:avPlayerLayer];  Also this is how I have the properties definied.  @property (strong) AVPlayer *player; @property (strong) AVPlayerLayer *avPlayerLayer; @property (strong) AVPlayerItem *currentItem;  Maybe that's entirely wrong as well. I'm not exactly sure when to use (strong) vs (weak). Any case thank you ahead of time for any help.
2409759,javascript,Problem exists only on FireFox (from 3.6 up to current 9) other browsers are fine. My code looks like this: jQuery.extend({ AnchorFromUrl : function(url) { var anchor = url.substr(1).replace('.html'''); $.fizzer_anchor = anchor; window.location.hash = anchor; return anchor; } });  The most weird thing is that if I place an alert before the window.location.hash = anchor; line after clicking Ok favicon doesn't disappear remove that alert() and you get your favicon disappearing. Note: it also drops the favicon if you just do window.location = something.
7365027,javascript,I would like to use create a object that contains regular expressions as the key value. I tried to use the following syntax: var kv = { /key/g : value };  But it fails according JavaScript lint: SyntaxError: invalid property id  How can I fix it? Update Background: The reason why I want to do this is to implement a workaround that fixes wrong unicode in a HTTP API result. I know this is very hackish but since I have no control over the API server code I think this is the best I can do. Currently I implemented the mapping by having a keys array and a values array: function fixUnicode(text) { var result = text; var keys = []; var values = []; keys.push(/&Atilde;&copy;/g); values.push( &eacute; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&uml;/g); values.push( &egrave; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&ordf;/g); values.push( &ecirc; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&laquo;/g); values.push( &euml; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&nbsp;/g); values.push( &agrave; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&curren;/g); values.push( &auml; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&cent;/g); values.push( &acirc; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&sup1;/g); values.push( &ugrave; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&raquo;/g); values.push( &ucirc; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&frac14;/g); values.push( &uuml; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&acute;/g); values.push( &ocirc; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&para;/g); values.push( &ouml; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&reg;/g); values.push( &icirc; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&macr;/g); values.push( &iuml; ); keys.push(/&Atilde;&sect;/g); values.push( &ccedil; ); for (var i = 0; i < keys.length; ++i) { result = result.replace(keys[i] values[i]); } return result; }  But I want to implement to use a JavaScript object to map keys as values: function fixUnicode(text) { var result = text; var keys = { /&Atilde;&copy;/g : &eacute;  /&Atilde;&uml;/g : &egrave; // etc... }; for (var key in keys) { result = result.replace(key keys[key]); } return result; } 
939386,javascript,There is a JSLint option one of The Good Parts in fact that [requires] parens around immediate invocations meaning that the construction (function () { // ... })();  would instead need to be written as (function () { // ... }());  My question is this -- can anyone explain why this second form might be considered better? Is it more resilient? Less error-prone? What advantage does it have over the first form?  Since asking this question I have come to understand the importance of having a clear visual distinction between function values and the values of functions. Consider the case where the result of immediate invocation is the right-hand side of an assignment expression: var someVar = (function () { // ... }());  Though the outermost parentheses are syntactically unnecessary the opening parenthesis gives an up-front indication that the value being assigned is not the function itself but rather the result of the function being invoked. This is similar to Crockford's advice regarding capitalization of constructor functions -- it is meant to serve as a visual cue to anyone looking at the source code.

30632736,ios,We have a large and complicated application and we are looking to upgrade our 3d engine to Unity 5.0. But I am having trouble integrating Unity. I been trying to follow these tutorials but constant errors keep poping up whatever I do. http://www.the-nerd.be/2014/09/08/sandbox-unity-app-in-existing-ios-app/ http://www.makethegame.net/unity/add-unity3d-to-native-ios-app-with-unity-5-and-vuforia-4-x/ http://www.markuszancolo.at/2014/05/integrating-unity-into-a-native-ios-app/ If I just add the Libraries and the Classes folders into my project I get an odd amount errors. It gets confused with other c code in the project(really doesn't like msgpack) and tries to import the wrong files (ILCPP files). If I remove all offending code from the project I still have a list of errors with the native cstring class.

Any help in this matter would be great as I'm totally stuck on what I should try next. Edit: A plain project worked so that is a start. Sounds like one of libraries is interfering maybe. The code base is large so need help narrowing the issue down.  Edit 2: Updated to Unity 5.1 xcode 7 beta clean deleted the DerivedData folder and still no change. Once I added -ferror-limit=1000 then I saw 999+ errors instead of 30.  Common errors:   Declaration conflicts with target of using declaration already in scope .

But I'm having a few other issues. Unity is still using CPU when I pause it. Is there anyway to solve this? I am calling Unity's applicationDidBecomeActive method. I also tried just calling UnityPause . Calling Unity's GetAppController() in my own code causes this error:  Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:   _GetAppController  referenced from: -[Test3d viewDidDisappear:] in Test3d.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7 
7212051,c++,Assuming I am only using them for normal GUI programs (no COM no ActiveX nothing fancy) what is the fundamental difference I will see between ATL and MFC to help me figure out which one to use?  I've done some searches on the web but ultimately none of the answers really answered my question:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bk8ytxz5(v=vs.80).aspx:   ATL is a fast easy way to both create a COM component in C++ and maintain a small footprint. Use ATL to create a control if you don't need all of the built-in functionality that MFC automatically provides.  Doesn't really answer my question because:  I'm not working with COM. Does this imply MFC isn't fast? Why/how?   MFC allows you to create full applications ActiveX controls and active documents. If you have already created a control with MFC you may want to continue development in MFC. When creating a new control consider using ATL if you don't need all of MFC's built-in functionality.  Also doesn't answer my question because:  I don't really even know what ActiveX is in the first place. It looks as though Microsoft is discouraging the use of MFC but I can't figure out why. What exactly is MFC's built-in functionality that ATL doesn't provide?  In general this doesn't answer my question because it doesn't explain the downsides and the reasons behind them.   because directly or indirectly everything seems to link back to the previous page:  How do I decide whether to use ATL MFC Win32 or CLR for a new C++ project?   ATL & MFC are somewhat trickier to decide between. [[No kidding!]] I'd refer you to MSDN's page for choosing in order to decide between them.  Obviously this doesn't answer my question. :)  http://www.codeguru.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-64778.html etc.  What I have currently observed (within the last couple of days while trying to learn both):  ATL is based on templates or compile-time polymorphism.  ATL methods tend to be non-virtual and tend to return references.  MFC is based on virtual methods or run-time polymorphism.  MFC methods tend to be virtual and tend to return pointers.   But there doesn't seem to be any architectural difference between them:  Both use message maps (BEGIN_MSG_MAP vs. BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP... big deal) Both wrap Win32 methods into classes Both seem to have similar classes CWnd vs. CWindow  But then if there's no real difference except for the compile-time vs. run-time aspect then why do both of them exist? Shouldn't one of them be enough? What am I missing here?

6841971,android,I have an overlay ViewGroup that is the size of the screen which I want to use to show an effect when the user interacts with the app but still passes the onTouch event to any underlying views.  I am intrested in all MotionEvents (not just DOWN) so onInterceptTouchEvent() does not apply here as if i return true my overlay will consume all events and if false will only receive the DOWN events (the same applys to onTouch). I thought I could override the Activitys dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) and call a custom touch event in my overlay but this has the effect of not translating the input coords depending on the position of my view (for example all events will pass appear to be happening 20 or so px below the actual touch as the system bar is not taken into account). Any pointers would be great thx!
5334383,javascript,Hey everyone this is #23 from John Resig Advanced JavaScript http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#23 called   What happens if a function is an object property.  1) regarding vocabulary the variable katana is the object right? If the anonymous function is its property then what is use called? I thought use would have also been called a property? or is use also an object because it contains a value namely a function? 2). Is the purpose of the function to change isSharp: true to isSharp: false? What does !this.isSharp exactly do?  3) When it asserts !katana.isSharp what is it actually asserting? that isSharp has now been set to false ?  var katana = { isSharp: true use: function(){ this.isSharp = !this.isSharp; } }; katana.use(); assert( !katana.isSharp Verify the value of isSharp has been changed. ); 
20584156,php,I had installed php mysql apache stack for development. That installation is using configuration files from /etc/apache2/ /etc/php5/  Later i installed multiple php version using phpbrew. All versions are accessible and switchable from CLI.

19798712,ios,In iOS 7 when a UIActionSheet is presented the system controls all animate their tintColor to gray. When the sheet is dismissed they animate back. I have some controls with custom background images or drawRect implementations that use the tint color and I'd like them to animate that change just like the system controls. Apple added - (void)tintColorDidChange to UIView but redrawing with the new color in this method doesn't animate the change — it just switches from full color to full gray immediately which looks bad when other system controls around it are animating. How can I make my custom-drawn controls animate the tintColor transition like Apple's?

7141509,python,I’m using a queue to exchange messages between a background thread and a Tk GUI application. Currently this is done by calling a query method every now and then. def read_queue(self): try: self.process(self.queue.get(False)) # non-blocking except Queue.Empty: pass finally: self.after(UPDATE_TIME self.read_queue)  The problem with this approach is that if UPDATE_TIME is too large the application will process new items slower than possible. If it is too small Tk spends most of the time checking the queue although it could do other stuff in the meantime. Is there a way to automatically trigger the read_queue method whenever a new item arrives in the queue? (I could certainly call a method on Tk when the background thread fills the queue but I fear that this gives me some concurrency issues – that’s why I’m using queues after all.)
4862523,ios,How do I send an email within an app without leaving the app.  This works:  -(void) sendEmailTo:(NSString *)to withSubject:(NSString *)subject withBody:(NSString *)body { NSString *mailString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@ mailto:?to=%@&subject=%@&body=%@  [to stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding] [subject stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding] [body stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding]]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:mailString]]; }  but goes to the mail app to send. Is there a way to do this without leaving the app?
18893880,ios,With the 64 bit version of iOS we can't use %d and %u anymore to format NSInteger and NSUInteger. Because for 64 bit those are typedef'd to long and unsigned long instead of int and unsigned int. So Xcode will throw warnings if you try to format NSInteger with %d. Xcode is nice to us and offers an replacement for those two cases which consists of a l-prefixed format specifier and a typecast to long. Then our code basically looks like this: NSLog(@ %ld  (long)i); NSLog(@ %lu  (unsigned long)u);  Which if you ask me is a pain in the eye.  A couple of days ago someone at Twitter mentioned the format specifiers %zd to format signed variables and %tu to format unsigned variables on 32 and 64 bit plattforms.  NSLog(@ %zd  i); NSLog(@ %tu  u);  Which seems to work. And which I like more than typecasting.  But I honestly have no idea why those work. Right now both are basically magic values for me.  I did a bit of research and figured out that the z prefix means that the following format specifier has the same size as size_t. But I have absolutely no idea what the prefix t means. So I have two questions: What exactly do %zd and %tu mean? And is it safe to use %zd and %tu instead of Apples suggestion to typecast to long?  I am aware of similar questions and Apples 64-Bit Transition guides which all recommend the %lu (unsigned long) approach. I am asking for an alternative to type casting.

12683834,python,I'm trying to copy /home/myUser/dir1/ and all its contents (and their contents etc.) to /home/myuser/dir2/ in python. Furthermore I want the copy to overwrite everything in dir2/. It looks like distutils.dir_util.copy_tree might be the right tool for the job but not sure if there's anything easier/more obvious to use for such a simple task. If it is the right tool how do I use it? According to the docs there are 8 parameters that it takes. Do I have to pass all 8 are just src dst and update and if so how (I'm brand new to Python). If there's something out there that's better can someone give me an example and point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance!
5086392,php,It seems they have done away with their API. They have a much less powerful tool called the Search Gateway. How would I go about scraping airfare price data using this? Is it even possible? I would rather work in PHP or Ruby on Rails if possible. Specifically I want to start gathering data on the lowest airfare price between approximately 10 pairs of cities. I would like to have data for each hour of the day. I could just check kayak by hand but I would like to be able to automate this process.

21878079,php,I am currently building a POS solution for my company. The hardest part is shopping for the cash drawer as I do not have much experience with them and would prefer a USB cash drawer. I have found a model I am interested in  CR-4005 http://www.thebarcodewarehouse.co.uk/epos-systems/cash-drawers/cr-4005-b/ The supplier includes a driver which can be found here  http://www.posiflexusa.com/driver.php This allows you to open the drawer etc using a dll file. An example of the codes given are like so: Public Declare Function OpenUSB Lib usbcr.dll () As Long  I have minor experience with C but with google I am sure I could figure this part out. The issue I am having is that the solution is just effectively a website hosted offsite what I need to be able to do is from the site issue commands to the client machine using it. So that when they complete a sale I can open the drawer for that particular machine. What I need to clarify is how I go about doing this. For example I would assume I install the driver on the client machine and plug the cash drawer in. Then when they access the site I need to execute the C command shown above to open the drawer. The problem i am having is wrapping my head around how this would work. Surely if I execute the command on the server it will effectively be looking at the servers usb ports and trying to open the drawer. Rather than issuing the command to the client machine. Therefore in order to work around this would it be possible to maybe have the c file on the clients machine and then I simply call a file on the site using something like C:\Windows\execute.bat  Which in turn calls the c file on the client machine. I understand I don't have a lot of information to provide as I am trying to figure this out before going ahead with the purchase and I am probably over complicating this but any pointers or info would be most appreciated. Also I am not completely set on this model so if you know an alternative with some good documentation or an existing solution I am open to this also. Notes I understand there could be a possible solution with chrome api calls I could potentially install xampp and create a simple php files that calls an exe which does the necessary work. Therefore maybe accessing a local address on the client machine could be another potential idea (ie 127.0.0.1/open.php). Update My Website including the POS side of things is built and ready to go. This is built using PHP and is hosted on an external server. We access the site via a domain. When the user performs a specific action on the external site it needs to open the staff members local till drawer either by opening a local file (ie an exe that can open the drawer) or by accessing say a local webserver on the machine ie localhost/open. The till drawer is the one listed above and it is connected via USB to the clients machine. No receipt printer is used.
7707842,c++,I know STL containers copy the objects. So say I have a  list<SampleClass> l;  each time when I do  SampleClass t(...); l.push_back(t);  a copy of t will be made. If SampleClass is large then it will be very costly.  But if I declare l as a container of references  list<SampleClass&> l;  When I do  l.push_back(t);  Will it avoid copying the objects?
5505130,php,I am getting numerous errors exactly like this one: Zend_Session_Exception: Session must be started before any output has been sent to the browser; output started in /usr/local/zend/share/pear/PHPUnit/Util/Printer.php/173  When running my application's test suite. This is with PHPUnit 3.5.10 and PHP 5.3.5. There is no mysterious unexpected whitespace output that is causing this. I've determined that the output being sent to the browser is the actual output from the PHPUnit tests being executed. If I open up PHPUnit/Util/Printer.php and wrap the print $buffer line with if (strpos($buffer 'PHPUnit 3.5.10 by Sebastian Bergmann') === false) (effectively stopping the first line of output from PHPUnit) then my first test succeeds (until the test case outputs a dot indicating that the test succeeded then the next test fails because the dot was output). Another developer on my team is able to run the full test suite successfully so I know it's not a problem with the application code. It must be some configuration setting or problem with my local environment. I've already checked php.ini to verify that output_buffering is turned on and implicit_flush is turned off and they are. I've also tried adding Zend_Session::$_unitTestEnabled = true; to my test bootstrap but that didn't help (and shouldn't be necessary anyway because it works on another developer's machine and on our CI server without it). Any suggestions besides ignoring the errors? I've never seen anything like this and am truly at a loss. Thanks! UPDATE: To attempt to further isolate the problem I took ZF and my application out of the equation by executing the following test script: <?php class SessionTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { public function testSession() { session_start(); $this->assertTrue(true); } }  The test fails: 1) SessionTest::testSession session_start(): Cannot send session cookie - headers already sent by (output started at /home/mmsa/test.php:1)  However the exact same test works on a friend's machine. Same version of PHP and PHPUnit.

3773338,android,I'm attempting to use an HttpDelete object to invoke a web service's delete method. The web service's code parses JSON from the message's body. However I'm failing to understand how to add a body to an HttpDelete object. Is there a way to do this? With HttpPut and HttpPost I call the setEntity method and pass in my JSON. There doesn't appear to be any such method for HttpDelete. If there is no way to set a body for an HttpDelete object could you please link me to a resource that uses a super class of HttpDelete such that I can set the method (delete) and set a body. I know that isn't ideal but at this point I can't alter the web service.
4911124,javascript|jquery,I am using jQuery Sortable. I have the HTML setup like so: <ul id='plan'> <li class='item'>1</li> <li class='item'>2</li> <li class='item'>3</li> <li class='item'>4</li> </ul>  I want to programmatically move an <li> to a different position. I can achieve this with the following JS: $( #plan li:eq(1) ).insertAfter($( #plan li:eq(2) ));  This works fine except it does not trigger the sortable events like change or update. I have a function which is run on the update event of the sortable but moving the li with JS does not trigger this. Does anyone know how to trigger the sortable update event?

7031210,c++,I tried out linux' perf utility today and am having trouble in interpreting its results. I'm used to valgrind's callgrind which is of course a totally different approach to the sampling based method of perf. What I did: perf record -g -p $(pidof someapp) perf report -g -n  Now I see something like this:  + 16.92% kdevelop libsqlite3.so.0.8.6 [.] 0x3fe57 ↑ + 10.61% kdevelop libQtGui.so.4.7.3 [.] 0x81e344 ▮ + 7.09% kdevelop libc-2.14.so [.] 0x85804 ▒ + 4.96% kdevelop libQtGui.so.4.7.3 [.] 0x265b69 ▒ + 3.50% kdevelop libQtCore.so.4.7.3 [.] 0x18608d ▒ + 2.68% kdevelop libc-2.14.so [.] memcpy ▒ + 1.15% kdevelop [kernel.kallsyms] [k] copy_user_generic_string ▒ + 0.90% kdevelop libQtGui.so.4.7.3 [.] QTransform::translate(double double) ▒ + 0.88% kdevelop libc-2.14.so [.] __libc_malloc ▒ + 0.85% kdevelop libc-2.14.so [.] memcpy ...  Ok these functions might be slow but how do I find out where they are getting called from? As all these hotspots lie in external libraries I see no way to optimize my code.  Basically I am looking for some kind of callgraph annotated with accumulated cost where my functions have a higher inclusive sampling cost than the library functions I call. Is this possible with perf? If so - how? Note: I found out that E unwraps the callgraph and gives somewhat more information. But the callgraph is often not deep enough and/or terminates randomly without giving information about how much info was spent where. Example:  - 10.26% kate libkatepartinterfaces.so.4.6.0 [.] Kate::TextLoader::readLine(int&... Kate::TextLoader::readLine(int& int&) Kate::TextBuffer::load(QString const& bool& bool&) KateBuffer::openFile(QString const&) KateDocument::openFile() 0x7fe37a81121c  Could it be an issue that I'm running on 64 bit?

16702398,php|javascript,[EDIT] : I guess people had problem to understand exactly what I mean so I completely rewrote my explanations. I work on a project where users can define a date format used in the whole site. It uses PHP date format standard. For example : year-month-day is set by Y-m-d . PHP standard uses single-character symbols like Y m d F j to describe the date format. As seen in the documentation : http://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.date.php Sometimes users can select a date thanks to a jQueryUI Datepicker. This component describes its date format with code-words like yy y mm dd D ... http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate I would like to display the dates in the same format for both PHP and the Datepicker. I mean that PHP should output the date as in the format set by user AND the Datepicker should show the selected date in the same format. Given that:  The date format is necessarily described PHP style  I can't know a priori which format was set by users  /!\ This not a problem of how to read/parse/display a date from a known format. Unfortunately Javascript date format description is not the same as in PHP. For instance these 2 date formats are equivalent but described differently in PHP and Javascript:  PHP : Y-m-d (set by users) Javascript : yy-mm-dd  As you can see I cannot just configure the datepicker with the PHP date format because it will be misunderstood or not recognized at all. Someone (in answers below) adviced to create my own date format standard converter  matching each PHP symbol with its equivalent in JS date format description. Just like:  Y => yy m => mm d => dd y => y z => o ...  And then replace each PHP symbol with the JS one. And so d/m/Y will be translated into dd/mm/yy  magically. But maybe somebody knows another proper way to make jQueryUI Datepicker understand PHP date format standard? EDIT: I wrote a tutorial that explains both the problem and the solution.

10850976,android,I have a Imageview set with a white background and 1dp padding this creates a border-like effect which is the wanted result. Now if I set the scaleType to centerCrop it ignores the padding on the top and bottom. So I still have my border on the left and right side but not on the top and bottom.

10587598,c++,I need to implement a prefix sum algorithm and would need it to be as fast as possible. Ex: [3 1 7 0 4 1 6 3] should give [3 4 11 11 15 16 22 25]  Is there a way to do this using SSE/mmx/SIMD cpu instruction? My first idea is to sum each pair in parallel recursively until all sum have been computed like below!  //in parallel do for (int i = 0; i<z.length; i++){ z[i] = x[i<<1] + x[(i<<1)+1]; }  To make the algorithm a little bit more clear z is not the final ouput but instead used to compute the ouput  int[] w = computePrefixSum(z); for (int i = 1; i<ouput.length; i++){ ouput[i] = (i%2==0) ? (x[i] + ouput[i-1]) : w[(i-1)>>1]; } 
16046387,javascript|jquery,I have a simple ajax call that is executing a function on the beforeSend and on complete. They execute fine but the beforeSend is seemingly not executed until after the success. On the before send there is a Please wait notification. If I put a break after the function in the beforeSend then it will show that notification and then hit the success. Without the break point then it will sit there and think while waiting for the response and then my please wait notification will appear for a fraction of a second after the success is hit. The desired functionality is to have the notification appear as soon as the request is sent so it displays while it is waiting for the response.  $.ajax({ type : 'POST' url : url async : false data : postData beforeSend : function (){ $.blockUI({ fadeIn : 0 fadeOut : 0 showOverlay : false }); } success : function (returnData) { //stuff } error : function (xhr textStatus errorThrown) { //other stuff } complete : function (){ $.unblockUI(); } });

Say I have a checkbox defined in html: <input type= checkbox value= checked name= check1 onclick= alert(this.value); >  And I have a jQuery statement that is triggered in a function: $('input[name=check1]').attr('checked' true);  The result is the checkbox gets checked but the javascript onclick event is not triggered (hence no alert). But if I were to trigger the click even manually as such: $('input[name=check1]').attr('checked' true).trigger('click');  The result is the checkbox gets checked javascript onclick event is triggered (and the value is correctly gotten) but then the checkbox gets unchecked after that.

10036610,javascript|jquery|html,How do I make it so that by default 6 div elements are shown on the page and when a user scrolls to the bottom of the page six more are loaded? If you see this example it has multiple divs. I want only 6 of them to be show initially and each time the user reaches the bottom of the page I want six more to be loaded until you 'run out' of divs.  So far I have tried experimenting with jQuery infinite scroll plugins but they are not applicable in my case as in fact the number of elements I have is very finite! How can this be accomplished using jQuery? Thanks in advance! EDIT I believe one could set the rest of the divs to hidden (apart from the first 6) and trigger a function that loads six more when the bottom of the page is reached.

19078278,ios,In iOS 7 we can now add a constraint between a view and the top layout guide which I think is very useful to solve the status bar offset issue in iOS7(especially when there is no navigation bar in the view). In a storyboard file I can add this kind of constraints easily. Just hold the control key then drag the view to the container it will show the Top Space to Top Layout Guide option.  But when I do the same operation in a xib file this option disappears.  So is there any way to add this kind of constraints in xib files? Or do I have to add them with code?
8093882,c++,While working with templates I ran into a need to make a base class constructors accessible from inherited classes for object creation to decrease copy/paste operations.

(A::A constructor is not overlapped) C c(10); // error: no matching function to call to 'C::C(int)' }  So my question: Is there any way to import a base class constructors after new ones in inherited class been declared? Or there is only one alternative to declare new constructors and call a base ones from initializer list?

13967883,android,I am developing mobile client for emailing service. One of the key features is notifications about new messages in the mailbox. As recommended by GCM architecture guidelines we are using a Pusher that is responsible for sending messages to the Google servers once we received a new message. The issue is that testing process has reported about serious problems with push notification delivery to devices.  So the question: is there an approaches for monitoring average statistics about push notification delivery percentage time etc? Or maybe somebody have experience in how to set up test environment for efficient monitoring of how much notifications are getting lost during the application work? All the tips&tricks related to the improving Android GCM experience are welcome.
15199437,html,Is there any simple way to have multiple embedded YouTube videos on a page and have them start playing as soon as the page is opened and when the first one finished have the second one start? I was hoping something like this would work: <object width= 425 height= 350 ><param name= movie value= http://www.youtube.com/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&autoplay=1 ></param><embed src= http://www.youtube.com/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&autoplay=1 type= application/x-shockwave-flash width= 425 height= 350 ></embed></object> <br> <object width= 425 height= 350 ><param name= movie value= http://www.youtube.com/v/NlXTv5Ondgs&autoplay=2 ></param><embed src= http://www.youtube.com/v/NlXTv5Ondgs&autoplay=2 type= application/x-shockwave-flash width= 425 height= 350 ></embed></object>  And it does for the first one but not the second. I would imagine that I may need to dive into the API. Anyone have any suggestions?

5690541,php|html,I think that this problem happens often on a web application. But I'll explain in details my troubles.  I'd like to know how to get rid of this behaviour for example when I've a code like this : <? if (isset($_POST['name'])) { ... operation on database like to insert $_POST['name'] in a table ... echo Operation Done ; die(); } ?> <form action='page.php' method='post' name= myForm > <input type= text maxlength= 50 name= name class= input400 /> <input type= submit name= Submit /> </form>  When I submit the form I insert the data on database and I get the message Operation Done. Than if I refresh the page the data will insered again. How can I avoid from this situation? Any suggestions will be good :)

5889973,java|jquery,Guys Well I have done enough research still I can't find the solution to this. In a nutshell I'm simply passing url encoded form data to the Controller method and trying to convert it as a domain object which has Date and integers. @RequestMapping(value = /savePassport  method = RequestMethod.POST) public @ResponseBody AjaxResponse savePassport(@RequestBody StaffPassport passport HttpServletResponse response) { // Some operations.  } The Staff Passport looks like this: import java.sql.Date; public class StaffPassport { private int staffId; private String passportNumber; private String placeOfIssue; private Date issueDate; private Date expiryDate; private String spouseName; private String oldPassportRef; private String visaInfo; private String description; //gets/sets }  When I invoke the /savePassport I get unsupported media exception. I guess it's related to casting. I can't this working right. Of course I can catch individual form data using @RequestParam and manually do the casting but that's not the point of a framework isn't it? Where am I going wrong? And you are right. I'm a beginner in Spring but I love it.
26780046,android,When I use drawables from the AppCompat library for my Toolbar menu items the tinting works as expected. Like this: <item android:id= @+id/action_clear android:icon= @drawable/abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha <-- from AppCompat android:title= @string/clear />  But if I use my own drawables or actually even copy the drawables from the AppCompat library to my own project it will not tint at all. <item android:id= @+id/action_clear android:icon= @drawable/abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha_copy <-- copy from AppCompat android:title= @string/clear />  Is there some special magic in the AppCompat Toolbar that only tint drawables from that library? Any way to get this to work with my own drawables? Running this on API Level 19 device with compileSdkVersion = 21 and targetSdkVersion = 21 and also using everything from AppCompat abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha_copy is an exact copy of the abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha png from AppCompat Edit: The tinting is based on the value I have set for android:textColorPrimary in my theme. E.g. <item name= android:textColorPrimary >#00FF00</item> would give me a green tint color. Screenshots Tinting working as expected with drawable from AppCompat  Tinting not working with drawable copied from AppCompat

11895606,android,I have this code here on the options menu  Dialog dialog = new Dialog(ScheduleActivity.this); dialog.setTitle( Add Event ); dialog.setContentView(R.layout.add_even_on); Button datePicker = (Button) dialog.findViewById(R.id.datePicker); final DialogFragment dateFrag = new MyDatePicker(); datePicker.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { dateFrag.show(getSupportFragmentManager() datePicker ); } }); dialog.show();  when say Add Event on the option menu is clicked a Dialog appears with a button that shows a DatePickerDialog and beside it is a TextView that reflects the date chosen in the DatePickerDialog here is the class I got from Androids Developer on how to use the DatePickerDialog.  class MyDatePicker extends DialogFragment implements DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener { int pYear; int pDay; int pMonth; @Override public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // Use the current date as the default date in the picker final Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance(); int year = c.get(Calendar.YEAR); int month = c.get(Calendar.MONTH); int day = c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH); // Create a new instance of DatePickerDialog and return it return new DatePickerDialog(getActivity() this year month day); } public void onDateSet(DatePicker view int year int month int day) { pYear = year; pDay = day; pMonth = month; } }  So my problem is that how do i get the Value in milleseconds when i click Set on the DatePickerDialog which in turn automatically closes it and returns to my Dialog which contains the button which open the DatePickerDialog and a Textview which reflects watever date is chosen the DatePickerDialog... i wont show the one i chose inside the DatePickerDialog...  Here is a picture of what i mean So when i click on the Pick Date Button a DatePickerDialog box appears as seen on the next picture    and when i click set i wanted to take into account the value in millseconds from that DatePickerDialog
11123189,ios,I would like to clarify this issue. I had installed Cocos2d 1.01 rc on my iMac with XCode 4.3 installed and I have now dowloaded v2.0 and wanted to install the templates (following the official guide). Unfortunately the terminal gives me permission denied messages on trying this operation.  I thought all I needed to do was a sudo su command and then a chmod and that's what I tried to do: sudo su chmod -R 0777 /Users/xxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/*  The result of this is which seems fine to me (read write and execute on all subdirectories of Templates): ls -l /Users/xxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ total 0 drwxrwxrwx 4 root staff 136 20 Giu 17:30 File Templates drwxrwxrwx 19 root staff 646 15 Mar 15:14 cocos2d  But when I install the templates I get the following which I don't quiet get.. It say DONE! but there are several errors in the terminal that say that was not possible to create directories because of permission (even if they all seem to have rwx set). Also well I try to create an empty Cocos2d project via XCode (after rebooting XCode) the cocos2d.m still shows version v1.0.1.

I will try to be as specific here as I can so I will give a direct example. And pleeeeease do not post any workarounds for this specific problem. I am not specifically interested how you can send an email much nicer with xyz. I want to know how you generally deal with dependent error prone statements. My question is how to handle exceptions nicely ones that depend on one another meaning: Only if the first step was successful try the next and so on. One more criterion is: All exceptions have to be caught this code has to be robust. For your consideration an example: try: server = smtplib.SMTP(host) #can throw an exception except smtplib.socket.gaierror: #actually it can throw a lot more this is just an example pass else: #only if no exception was thrown we may continue try: server.login(username password) except SMTPAuthenticationError: pass # do some stuff here finally: #we can only run this when the first try...except was successful #else this throws an exception itself! server.quit() else: try: # this is already the 3rd nested try...except # for such a simple procedure! horrible server.sendmail(addr [to] msg.as_string()) return True except Exception: return False finally: server.quit() return False  This looks extremely unpythonic to me and the error handling code is triple the real business code but on the other hand how can I handle several statements that are dependent on one another meaning statement1 is prerequisite for statement2 and so on? I am also interested in proper resource cleanup even Python can manage that for itself.  Thanks Tom
9262278,python|html,This related to this question: Django return json and html depending on client python I have a command line python api for a django app. When I access the app through the api it should return json and with a browser it should return html. I can use different urls to access the different versions but how do I render the html template and json in the views.py with just one template? To render the html I would use:  return render_to_response('sample/sample.html....)  But how would I do the same for json without putting a json template? (the content-type should be application/json instead of text/html) Edit 1: What would determine the json and html outputs? So in my views:  if something: return render_to_response('html_template'.....) else: return HttpReponse(jsondatamimetype='application/json')  Thank you
13089234,python,I'm new to Python. I want to be able to open a file and replace every instance of certain words with a given replacement via Python. as an example say replace every word 'zero' with '0' 'temp' with 'bob' and say 'garbage' with 'nothing'. I had first started to use this: for line in fileinput.input(fin): fout.write(line.replace('zero' '0')) fout.write(line.replace('temp''bob')) fout.write(line.replace('garbage''nothing'))  but I don't think this is an even remotely correct way to do this. I then thought about doing if statements to check if the line contains these items and if it does then replace which one the line contains but from what I know of Python this also isn't truly an ideal solution. I would love to know what the best way to do this. Thanks ahead of time!

1500363,c++,This is just something that has bothered me for the last couple of days I don't think it's possible to solve but I've seen template magic before. Here goes: To get the number of elements in a standard C++ array I could use either a macro (1) or a typesafe inline function (2): (1) #define sizeof_array(ARRAY) (sizeof(ARRAY)/sizeof(ARRAY[0]))  (2) template <typename T> size_t sizeof_array(const T& ARRAY){ return (sizeof(ARRAY)/sizeof(ARRAY[0])); }  As you can see the first one has the problem of being a macro (for the moment I consider that a problem) and the other one has the problem of not being able to get the size of an array at compile time; ie I can't write: enum ENUM{N=sizeof_array(ARRAY)};  or BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof_array(ARRAY)==10);// Assuming the size 10..  Does anyone know if this can be solved?

4196201,c++,In C/C++ the main function receives parameters which is of type char*. int main(int argc char* argv[]){ return 0; }  argv is array of char* they point to strings. Where do these string locate? Are they on heap or stack or somewhere else?
4691608,c++,If the array was null-terminated this would be pretty straight forward: unsigned char u_array[4] = { 'a' 's' 'd' '\0' }; std::string str = reinterpret_cast<char*>(u_array); std::cout << -> << str << std::endl;  However I wonder what is the most appropriate way to copy a non null-terminated unsigned char array like the following: unsigned char u_array[4] = { 'a' 's' 'd' 'f' };  into a std::string.  Is there any way to do it without iterating over the unsigned char array? Thank you all.

977105,c#|c++,I know Joel says to never do it and I agree with this in most cases. I do think there are cases where it is justified. We have a large C++ application (around 250000 total lines of code) that uses a MFC front end and a Windows service as the core components. We are thinking about moving the project to C#. The reasons we are thinking about rewriting are:  Faster development time Use of WCF and other .NET built-in features More consistent operation on various systems Easier 64 bit support Many nice .NET libraries and components out there  Has anyone done a rewrite like this? Was it successful?  EDIT: The project is almost 10 years old now and we are getting to the point that adding new features we want would be writing significant functionality that .NET already has built-in.

2028697,android,Coming from the .NET-environment Im am now looking to understand how Dialogs work in Android. In .NET when calling MessageBox.Show(...)  that creates and shows a popup dialog. In the call to Show I can specify what buttons should be available in the popup for example: DialogResult myDialogResult = MessageBox.Show( My text here  My caption here  MessageBoxButtons.YesNoCancel);  As you can see the call to Show returns a DialogResult when a button is pressed in the popup informing me what button was clicked. Note that in .NET execution is halted at the line where the call to Show(...) is made so it can return the value when a button is pressed. If I in the above example press No the myDialogResult will be equal to  myDialogResult == DialogResult.No  Since I find the .NET-way of using/creating popups very easy and intuitive I would like that way of creating popups in Android too.  So the question is if anyone know how to halt execution like with the MessageBox.Show and then return a value whenever the Button is pressed (and the dialog goes away)? Regards  EDIT 1: To be a little bit more clear: I need for the execution to halt and wait until the user has chosen a button to click in the popup. The code that follow the call to show the Dialog is dependent on what button is clicked in the Dialog. Thats why I cannot use what Erich and Alex suggest since writing code in the onClick-methods as suggested below is not gonna work. The reason is that I cannot continue the normal execution . Let me take an example: Let me take an example: int nextStep = 0; // this variable will not be reached from within the onClick-methods AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this); builder.setMessage( Hello! ) .setPositiveButton( Ok  new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog int id) { nextStep = 1; // *** COMPILER ERROR!! *** } }) .setNegativeButton( Cancel  new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog int id) { nextStep = 2; // *** COMPILER ERROR!! *** } }) .create().show(); if (nextStep == 1) { // then do some damage } else if (nextStep == 2 // dont do damage  If I wanted the execution to be dependent on the choice in the popup I would somehow have to make all the variables in the normal execution (in this case nextStep) available in the onClick-methods and that sounds like hell to me. EDIT 2: Another obvious example would be a popup asking  Do you want to continue  with the options  Yes  and  No . If the user presses Yes  the whole method should be aborted otherwise it should continue execution. How do you solve that nicely? Regards
17533307,ios,Looking at the example at  https://www.parse.com/tutorials/integrating-facebook-in-ios I can't make heads or tails of how I logout an enduser. // from the viewcontroller.h file. // UINavigationBar button touch handler - (void)logoutButtonTouchHandler:(id)sender; // And apparently this line -> (void)logoutButtonTouchHandler:(id)sender { // Logout user this automatically clears the cache [PFUser logOut]; // Return to login view controller. From the view controller.m file. [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimated:YES]; }  There's just one little problem with this how is the logout button is being generated....because its not being generated at all! Anyone care to illuminate reality for me ???? Thanks. Miles.
8459788,c++,I'm trying to learn some basics of boost serialization.

So every button has it's unique ID coming from the fitting database entry. The second code example describes a table generated from database entries every table gets a unique ID coming from the fitting database entry. The third code example should get the ID of the button I click get the table with the same ID as the button hide all tables and only show the table with the same ID as the button. The problem is that it won't show anyting. It just hides all tables... Just to let you know I'm completly new to javascript/jQuery.

36755069,python,Right now I have a script in python that allows me to track a colored ball in a video file. We're testing a robots velocity using a stationary camera so I only need to track the color over a small span of the video's actual frame area and the rest can be discarded/ignored. Right now my process is to trim the video trials to only what I need to be tracked but with 15 trials per test it becomes very time consuming. black out the sides of the video not within the blue lines Basically how would I go about blacking out two sides of the video's area so that the color tracking isn't initiated until the robot enters the desired area?

10627648,php|javascript|jquery,I have a google api3 map. On idle I calculate the radius of the visible area of the map perform an ajax request and retrieve all of the markers in the visible area from an xml document.  Then I parse the xml clear the current map markers and replace them with the new markers.  This works with two caveats. 1) All of the markers flash when reloading. and 2) This causes me to download and reload markers even if the user did not move the map far enough for them to be off-screen. In other words I am reloading a marker that is already on the screen.  What is the best way to pull only the markers in the visible area of the map and aren't already on the screen? I am going for performance because I have a large amount of markers. Test Url: http://whosopennow.com/maintenance/test.php# (Pan to Washington DC)

33022423,python,I've read that when python evaluates a conditional that something like if x: would be translated to if bool(x):. Why then do I see a lot of code that calls bool() directly? Is this mostly for readability or is there some other advantage?

19687977,python,I've got a question about itteration in python. At the moment I am trying to build a very simple neural net using the following (parts of the) code: class neural_net: def __init__(self n_neurons n_input): self.n_neurons = n_neurons self.n_input = n_input self.input = [] self.weights = [] self.output = [] def generate_input(self): input = [0.00.01.0] self.input = input def generate_random_weights(self): weights = [[0] * self.n_input ] * (self.n_neurons) for i in range(self.n_neurons): for ii in range(self.n_input): weights[i][ii] = round(random.random() 1) self.weights = weights  In the function generate_random_weights i=0 and i=1 are always updates at the same time. The result is always something like the following when a print it using print'weights:' self.weights: weights: [[0.2 01 08] [02 01 08]]  The first and the second list are always the same: does anyone know why this happens? 
28943755,python,I have a JS module (a bunch of interface code). Let's call it mymodule. It is located at myapp/modules/mymodule. I want to keep together urls.py and views.py associated with this module. In other words I want to somehow reference myapp/modules/mymodule/urls.py from my root myapp/urls.py and not to cram my root myapp/views.py with all those handlers associated with mymodule. So this is what I tried by now: ## myapp/urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from myapp import views urlpatters = [ url(r'^$' views.index name = 'index') ... a lot of other urls ... and now I want to include urls associated with mymodule url(r'^mymodule/'include('myapp.modules.mymodule.urls')) ] ## myapp/modules/mymodule/urls.py from myapp.modules.mymodule import handlers urlpatters = [ url(r'^dosomething/'handlers.dosomething) ] ## myapp/modules/mymodule/handlers.py from django.http import HttpResponse def dosomething(request): return HttpResponse( Hello world! )  And I want this - when a user goes to 127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/mymodule/dosomething he or she should see Hello world! message. EDIT My updated version of the code which still leads to Page not found error looks like this: ## myapp/urls.py from django.conf.urls import * from myapp import views urlpatterns = patterns('' url(r'^$'views.index name='index') ... a lot of other working urls url(r'^myapp/mymodule'include('myapp.modules.mymodule.urls')) ) ## myapp/modules/mymodule/urls.py from django.conf.urls import * from myapp.modules.mymodule import handlers urlpatterns = patterns('' url(r'^dosomething/'handlers.dosomething) ) ## myapp/modules/mymodule/handlers.py from django.http import HttpResponse def dosomething(request): return HttpResponse( Hello world! )  EDIT My root urls.py file now looks like this: ## myapp/urls.py from django.conf.urls import * from myapp import views urlpatterns = patterns('' url(r'^$'views.index name='index') ... a lot of other working urls url(r'^myapp/mymodule/'include('myapp.modules.mymodule.urls')) )  So there is an ending slash now but the problem is - when I go to 127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/mymodule/dosomething the Django debugger says that Page not found and that it tried just ^myapp/ ^myapp/mymodule/ pattern - so I see no mentioning of ^dosomething/ pattern. However if I now go to 127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/myapp/mymodule/dosomething I now see in the debugger page that it tried ^myapp/ ^myapp/mymodule/ /dosomething pattern. It says /dosomething because I played with mymodule/urls.py and now it looks like: ## myapp/modules/mymodule/urls.py from django.conf.urls import * from myapp.modules.mymodule import handlers urlpatterns = patterns('' url(r'/dosomething'handlers.dosomething) )  So I guess the reason of all these troubles is that I can't combine all these patterns together to make them work. I need clear understanding on how my url pattern should look like inside root urls.py and inside myapp/urls.py
24102167,c++,I have the following code: template<typename T> class A{ public: class B; }; template<typename T> class A<T>::B{ public: template<typename Y> friend typename A<Y>::B operator+(typename A<Y>::B& bint num){ return b; } }; int main(){ A<int>::B a; A<int>::B b = operator+(a1); // gives an error: no matching function for call to //'operator+(A<int>::B& int)' A<int>::B b = operator+<int>(a1); // works return 0; }  As mentioned in the title and the comments; why can't the compiler deduce the template parameters? It's important because I don't know how the person who will test it will use it. By the way if I define it as member function it works but I still want to know why this way it doesn't. Plus if I define operator+(intA<int>::B) it gives the same error (and obviously can't be member function).
36586283,javascript|android|jquery|html,Hi I have problem with setting  if (buttonIndex == 1) { //do stuff } else if (buttonIndex == 2) { //II do stuff }  so is the app knows about buttonIndex in if ? Whether it knows only in function onConfirm(buttonIndex){} about buttonIndex? Generally is it about confirm dialog https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-dialogs#navigatornotificationconfirm this dialog works but only display info when clicked 'Tak' so buttonIndex == 1 (Tak is in English Yes) then I want to append <li> with name chipsy(in English chips) and a button to <ul> this doesn't work here is my code http://pastebin.com/Wf7untcY It is an issue with appending or with buttonIndex?
37241575,python,I have a view that I set up that allows me to view all the training for a specific employee profile: class ManageTrainingView(LoginRequiredMixin generic.ListView): login_url = reverse_lazy('users:login') model = Training template_name = 'ppm/training.html' paginate_by = 10 # Get training queryset for specific profile id def get_queryset(self): pk = self.kwargs['pk'] return Training.objects.filter(profile_id=pk)  The problem I'm have is that I'm trying to add more training for a specific employee profile using a profile id instead of a user id. In my training.html template this Works training.html <li><a href= {% url 'ppm:add-training' user.id %} >Add Training</a></li>  But this doesn't(NoReverseMatch) <li><a href= {% url 'ppm:add-training' profile.id %} >Add Training</a></li>  So my question is what do I need to do in order to add training for a specific employee profile instead of a user? How do I access the profile object that I'm currently on in the template so that profile.id will work?
36671449,python,Background: I'm utilizing 2 dictionaries. For my purposes the first governor_db is a dictionary contains a governor's name as the key and the values are just sets of information that go with it like the year they served etc. The second is a dictionary that contains the year as the key and the values are the unemployment for each month of that year (the key). What I'm currently working on: The function I'm working on calls a previous function I used to calculate the average unemployment per governor during the years they served. What I have (below) is iterating through the name of the governor and pulling the average unemployment into this new function to be able to compare what the lowest average unemployment is and who the governor was with that piece of information.  So far what I have will either iterate through it and give me the lowest unemployment accurately  but won't give the right governor that goes with that lowest value.  My current code: def governor_lowest_avg_unemployment(g_dbunemployment_db): all_unemploy={} for governor in g_db.keys(): avg_unemploy= avg_unemployment_for_governor(g_dbunemployment_db governor) if avg_unemploy==None: all_unemploy[governor]=0 else: all_unemploy[state]= avg_unemploy lowest_avg= min(all_unemploy.values()) for key value in all_unemploy.items(): if value == lowest_avg: lowest_gov= keyvalue return(lowest_gov)  What I want to try to do is as I'm iterating through that dictionary and it's corresponding unemployment value (stored in dictionary all_unemploy above) I want to be able to store the previous value and compare if the new value I am iterating through is smaller than the previous one. If the new value is smaller than the previous I want to replace the previous one with the new one and go one until it stops iterating through the dictionary and give me the right tuple combination of lowest avg of : (Governor average unemployment)  Idea I started was to do something like the following. I'm not sure how to implement it though: for key value in all_unemploy: if value> previous pass elif value == previous pass elif value = None pass elif value < previous lowest = key value return lowest  None in this case just means that for the previous function there wasn't enough information in the unemployment database to calculate that governor's average unemployment rate. How would I be able to compare the values like so and end up getting an accurate lowest value ? Am I on the right track with my idea of implementing such a thing?

32073187,android,I have a custom view that has a draw method that should draw a red oval that covers the screen but nothing is happening. I checked that my custom view's draw method was being called and it was. This is the class: public class CustomView extends View { Paint red = new Paint(); RectF ovalRec = new RectF(00MainActivity.dUWidthMainActivity.dUHeight); public CustomView(Context context AttributeSet attrs) { super(context attrs); red.setARGB(255 255 0 0); } protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) { Log.i( log_tag  DRAWING THE OVAL ); canvas.drawOval(ovalRec red); super.onDraw(canvas); } }  Here you can see what dUWidth and dUHeight are. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { public static int dUWidth; public static int dUHeight; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // Auto-gen code super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); //Getting height & width of USABLE display and setting it to Point variable. Display display = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay(); Point sizeOfDisplay = new Point(); display.getSize(sizeOfDisplay); dUWidth = sizeOfDisplay.x; dUHeight = sizeOfDisplay.y; }  Here is the declaration of it in XML: <RelativeLayout xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android xmlns:tools= http://schemas.android.com/tools android:layout_width= match_parent android:layout_height= match_parent android:paddingLeft= @dimen/activity_horizontal_margin android:paddingRight= @dimen/activity_horizontal_margin android:paddingTop= @dimen/activity_vertical_margin android:paddingBottom= @dimen/activity_vertical_margin tools:context= .MainActivity > <com.XXX.targetexercise.CustomView android:layout_width= match_parent android:layout_height= match_parent /> </RelativeLayout>

33056733,java|android,I am trying to create a simple android game where 10 checkboxes appear randomly on the screen and you have to check all of them as fast as you can. Then all checkboxes are deleted. The first part of the code works 10 checkboxes are created. But if I add the second part of the code it doesnt work at all not even checkboxes appear and app freezes. public void checkbox(View v) { CheckBox[] cb = new CheckBox[10];  RelativeLayout r = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout); for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { cb[i] = new CheckBox(this); CheckBox c =cb[i]; int randy = (int) Math.floor(Math.random() * 1100 + 90); int randx = (int) Math.floor(Math.random() * 600); RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(90 90); params.leftMargin = randx; params.topMargin = randy; c.setId(i); r.addView(c params);} while (!checked(cb)){} //wait untill checked(cb)=true r.removeAllViews(); } public boolean checked(CheckBox[] cb) { //returns true if all checkboxes are checked boolean b = true; for (CheckBox c:cb) { if (!c.isChecked()){ b=false; } } return b; }  Edited code: int CheckedCount = 0; int j = 0; CheckBox[] cb = new CheckBox[10]; Boolean[] checked = new Boolean[10]; public void checkbox(View v) { Arrays.fill(checked Boolean.FALSE); RelativeLayout r = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout); for ( j = 0; j < 10; j++) { cb[j] = new CheckBox(this); CheckBox c =cb[j]; int randy = (int) Math.floor(Math.random() * 1100 + 90); int randx = (int) Math.floor(Math.random() * 600); RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(90 90); params.leftMargin = randx; params.topMargin = randy; c.setId(j); //id set for each checkbox c.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener() { @Override public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton compoundButton boolean b) { //missing code boolean c =true; for (boolean d:checked){ if (!d){ c=false; } } if (c) { RelativeLayout r = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout); r.removeAllViews(); } /* //old code CheckedCount++; if (CheckedCount == 10) { RelativeLayout r = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout); for (int a= 0; a<10;a++){ CheckBox c = cb[i]; r.removeView(c); } r.removeAllViews(); }*/ } }); r.addView(c params); } }} 
30891818,c++,When I did netstat -anto I got the following output Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State Timer tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:1169 127.0.0.1:40238 ESTABLISHED off (0.00/0/0)  I guess off means that the keepalive timer is off. Can we enable keepalive from client side socket? Or it can be enabled only for server-side code? How to enable it from the client?
15489550,python,I want to parse a path (not filename) by the forward slash. Below takes the full path filename and reads up to the 7th / .  EDIT: I realized the above was confusing when I stated filename. I meant I needed to parse the full path. e.g. I could need the first 7 / s to the left and remove 5 trailing / s.  Python:  / .join(filename.split( / )[:7])  Bash: some command that prints filename | cut -d'/' -f1-7`  It looks so much cleaner with the cut tool. Is there a better/ more efficient way to write this in Python?

15624244,javascript|jquery,I wrote a jQuery plugin everything seems fine until I ran my plugin on an non-existent DOM element. I was expecting that the alert box wouldn't pop up since $( #div1 ) would've returned empty set html <div id= div2 >hello</div>  javascript (function($){ $.fn.extend({myPlugin1: function(options){ alert('plugin run'); return this; } }); })(jQuery); $( #div1 ).myPlugin1();  jsfiddle Notice the DOM element has id div2 while the plugin is called on div1. 
37080362,python,I am trying to return a sentence length <= of a list index using the split() method. If i input the exact length of a certain index this works but < doesn't seem to do anything. Here is my code: stories = [['With bloody hands I say good-bye.'] ['TIME MACHINE REACHES FUTURE!!! ... nobody there ...'] [ Not In My Job Description: Make sure it's done by the end of the day Jones.\nBut sir it's not in my ....\nJust do it and remember no blood. ]] def len_sentence(): search = int(input( Enter int )) for i in stories: len1 = (i[0][0:].split(' ')) if len(len1) <= search: print(i) len_sentence()  User input of integers 1-5 returns nothing. If I replace <= with >= this works. Why doesn't < do anything?
37350223,python,My apologies in advance if I am not very clear (I am still programming in a rather childlish way). I am trying to move from Eclipse to PyCharm (community version) and so far no issues with the editor or cloning from github. However I am having doubts on how to use classes and modules from an external project: In Eclipse I would go to: Windows -> Preferences -> Interpreter -> Python Interpreter and over here add new folder which would be the subfolder within Eclipse workspace folder where I am saving the project. In PyCharm I am using File -> Preferences -> Project: Project_Name1 and over here I have the possibility to mark as sources (or excluded) all the project folders I want.  This brings me many doubts...  I imported several repositories (my own) from github and I set the option to keep open in the same window as the first (this option is new compared with eclipse but it gives me the same output with all the project within the package explorer). However when I got to File -> Preferences -> Project: Only the first project appears independently which one I have selected. How can I modify the interpreter and/or dependencies for the rest? If I add a project folder to the project structure do I also need to modify the project dependencies?  Incidentally any guide or tutorial on the right so it imports are not broken with each new IDE or when the code is shared would be most welcomed.
34102251,ios,I have 2 View Controllers - TableContainer and TableView. TableView is UIViewController subclass that conforms to UITableViewDataSource and Delegate. a UITableView is a property in the TableView controller.  I init 5 TableView controllers in TableContainer and add the tableView properties as subviews of the main TableContainer view.  I then layout with NSLayoutConstraint to fit the 5 tableViews in the TableContainer view. I get this crash  'NSInvalidArgumentException' reason: '*** +[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:attribute:relatedBy:toItem:attribute:multiplier:constant:]: Constraint must contain a first layout item'  I've logged it and the reason is that the tableView property is null. However I've run the same exact code with the TableView controller not as a subclassed UIViewController but as an actual UITableViewController and it works fine. Code follows TableView.h #import <UIKit/UIKit.h> @interface TableView : UIViewController <UITableViewDelegate UITableViewDataSource> @property (strong nonatomic) UITableView *tableView;  TableView.m (leaving out delegate and datasource methods because I've tested and those work fine) @interface TableView () @end @implementation TableView - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; self.tableView = [[UITableView alloc]init]; self.tableView.userInteractionEnabled = FALSE; [self.tableView setSeparatorStyle:UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone]; [self.tableView setShowsVerticalScrollIndicator:NO]; self.tableView.delegate = self; self.tableView.dataSource = self; }  TableContainer.h @interface TableContainer : UIViewController @property (strong nonatomic) TableView *tvVC1; @property (strong nonatomic) TableView *tvVC2; @property (strong nonatomic) TableView *tvVC3; @property (strong nonatomic) TableView *tvVC4; @property (strong nonatomic) TableView *tvVC5; @end  TableContainer.m (omitting code for constraints for tvVC's 2-5 as they are the same as the one for tvVC1.) @implementation TableContainer - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; self.tvVC1 = [[TableView alloc]init]; [self.view addSubview:self.tvVC1.tableView]; self.tvVC2 = [[TableView alloc]init]; [self.view addSubview:self.tvVC2.tableView]; self.tvVC3 = [[TableView alloc]init]; [self.view addSubview:self.tvVC3.tableView]; self.tvVC4 = [[TableView alloc]init]; [self.view addSubview:self.tvVC4.tableView]; self.tvVC5 = [[TableView alloc]init]; [self.view addSubview:self.tvVC5.tableView]; } -(void)viewDidAppear{ UILayoutGuide *layoutGuide = self.view.layoutMarginsGuide; self.tvVC1.tableView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = FALSE; NSLayoutConstraint *vc1 = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self.tvVC1.tableView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeWidth relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self.view attribute:NSLayoutAttributeWidth multiplier:0.2f constant:0.0f]; vc1.active = TRUE; [self.tvVC1.tableView.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:layoutGuide.leadingAnchor].active = TRUE; [self.tvVC1.tableView.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:layoutGuide.topAnchor].active = TRUE; [self.tvVC1.tableView.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:layoutGuide.bottomAnchor].active = TRUE; 
29187803,android,I'm using the solution here to add markers to a map in a Fragment and can't figure out why I can only add one marker.

I am retrieving an ArrayList of geocoordinates on the main thread and want to loop through the list in the map tab calling addLocationToMap on each entry. Here's my code: public class RentalMapFragment extends Fragment { MapView mMapView; private GoogleMap googleMap; @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater ViewGroup container Bundle savedInstanceState) { // inflate and return the layout View v = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_map container false); mMapView = (MapView) v.findViewById(R.id.mapView); mMapView.onCreate(savedInstanceState); mMapView.onResume();// needed to get the map to display immediately try { MapsInitializer.initialize(getActivity().getApplicationContext()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } googleMap = mMapView.getMap(); int level = 12; addLocationToMap(17.385044 78.486679 Marker 2  level); addLocationToMap(17.385044 78.486671 Marker 1  level); // Perform any camera updates here CameraPosition cameraPosition = new CameraPosition.Builder().target(new LatLng(17.385000 78.486600)).zoom(level).build(); googleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition(cameraPosition)); return v; } private void addLocationToMap(double latitude double longitude String markerTitle int level) { // Create lat/lon LatLng latLng = new LatLng(latitude longitude); // create marker MarkerOptions marker = new MarkerOptions().position(latLng).title(markerTitle); // Changing marker icon marker.icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(BitmapDescriptorFactory.HUE_ROSE)); // adding marker googleMap.addMarker(marker); } @Override public void onResume() { super.onResume(); mMapView.onResume(); } @Override public void onPause() { super.onPause(); mMapView.onPause(); } @Override public void onDestroy() { super.onDestroy(); mMapView.onDestroy(); } @Override public void onLowMemory() { super.onLowMemory(); mMapView.onLowMemory(); }  }
30739885,android,I have different text view in the main activity and each one when clicked leads to another activity. All of them but the first one are disabled. The process should be when being done with the first activity click the done button and it enables the next text view and also I want keep the first text view enabled just incase the user wants to go back and fix his info. What I am trying to do is every time the user hits the done button it brings you back to the main activity and put an image or icon of a checked mark right next to the text view = activity that the user was done with.  Main Activity So basically in this main i receive an receive an intent from my other activities and i get a userNumber that is going to decide in witch If is going to go in.  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); //text view's in the main activity personal = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.personal); preference = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.preference); music = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.music); sports = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.sports); //Each image view in the main activity Icheck4 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.ICheck4); Icheck3 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.ICheck3); Icheck2 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.ICheck2); Icheck1 = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.ICheck1); Intent in = getIntent(); preference.setEnabled(false); music.setEnabled(false); sports.setEnabled(false); Icheck1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); Icheck2.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); Icheck3.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); Icheck4.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); int myValue = in.getIntExtra( parametername1  0); if (myValue == 1) { Icheck1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); preference.setEnabled(true); } if (myValue2 == 2) { Icheck2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); preference.setEnabled(true); music.setEnabled(true); } if (myValue == 3) { Icheck3.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); preference.setEnabled(true); music.setEnabled(true); sports.setEnabled(true); } if (myValue == 4) { Icheck4.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); preference.setEnabled(true); music.setEnabled(true); sports.setEnabled(true); } }  First Activity in this activity i created a callClick method so that every time the button clicks it sends a userNumber and it also gets me back to the Main Activity. and in the 2 3 and 4 activity i have the same thing except the userNumber changes because the user number is what is going to decide in witch IF is gonna go in in the Main Activity public void callClick(View v){ int userNumber = 1; Intent in = new Intent(MainActivity2Activity.this MainActivity.class); in.putExtra( parametername1  userNumber); startActivity(in); }  The problem than im having is that every time the user goes back to one of the earlier text views to edit his info the text views below that one get disabled again and also the checkmarks don't stay visible. How can i Fix this ??? Please. Is there a way that i could just launch and image instead of just having it invisible ??? 
37546120,c++,I have an ATL project where I need to perform various initialization routines inside CComObjectRootEx::FinalConstruct. For demonstration purposes consider the following implementation: HRESULT FinalConstruct() { return m_bInit ? S_OK : E_FAIL; }  This should return the appropriate HRESULT to the caller indicating whether the initialization of the object was successful. However the client always receives REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG instead of E_FAIL in case of failure when trying to create the server:  #include <Windows.h> #import <finalconstructtest.dll> int main() { HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(0); { finalconstructtestLib::IFCClassPtr p; // Returns REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG hr = p.CreateInstance(__uuidof(finalconstructtestLib::FCClass)); } CoUninitialize(); return 0; }  When I change the class context to CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER however the intended HRESULT is returned correctly: // Returns E_FAIL hr = p.CreateInstance(__uuidof(finalconstructtestLib::FCClass) nullptr CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER);  I've seen this post where a similar behavior could be observed. However I can't seem to find any reason why the class context affects the return value of FinalConstruct. Is this intended and perhaps documented somewhere?
24662939,ios,I'm using SpriteBuilder to design levels for a game. In the game I have a block object that moves when swiped. However when I have more than one of those objects in the level each one only references the last one added. They all get initialized as unique objects but when I swipe they don't move. The only one that works correctly is the last one added to the level. The swipe gestures are here.  - (void)didLoadFromCCB { // Listen for swipe gestures to the right and left UISwipeGestureRecognizer * swipeRight= [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(swipeRight)]; swipeRight.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight; [[[CCDirector sharedDirector] view] addGestureRecognizer:swipeRight]; UISwipeGestureRecognizer * swipeLeft= [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(swipeLeft)]; swipeLeft.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft; [[[CCDirector sharedDirector] view] addGestureRecognizer:swipeLeft]; }  And here is one of the swiping methods that logs the wrong object as self. I also have a touch began method that is logging the correct object.  - (void)swipeRight { // Only move the object if it is being touched while swiping CCLOG(@ Swipe right %@  self); if (self.touched) { // Move the object off the screen to the right float width = [self parent].contentSizeInPoints.width; [self swipeOffScreen:ccp(self.position.x + width self.position.y)]; } } 
10902007,javascript|jquery,I have been trying to tune up a menu slideshow and have part of my code shown below which I have for each of the 4 items in the menu respectively. I made it so if you move your cursor over a given menu item the corresponding div is shown in the display. I also added a timeout so if you moved from one menu item to another quickly it doesn't switch from one div to another very quickly. The question I have now to make it work exactly as desired is  how do I make it so that it checks whether the cursor is still hovering over a given menu item after 200 milliseconds for example before switching to that menu item? Any comments or help is appreciated. Thanks. $( div#menu .reps ).hover(function() { window.clearTimeout(timeoutID); timeoutID = window.setTimeout(hoverFunctionReps 280); }); function hoverFunctionReps(){ if(current_slide != reps ){ $( .arrow ).animate({ left : 135px }); if(current_slide == clients ){ $( .clients_display ).stop(truetrue).fadeOut().hide(); $( .reps_display ).fadeIn().show(); current_slide = reps ; } else if(current_slide == services ){ $( .services_display ).stop(truetrue).fadeOut().hide(); $( .reps_display ).fadeIn().show(); current_slide = reps ; } else{ $( .training_display ).stop(truetrue).fadeOut().hide(); $( .reps_display ).fadeIn().show(); current_slide = reps ; } } }

UINavigationController navCont.popToRootViewControllerAnimated(true) } }  ORIGINAL QUESTION: I have some code that will delete data another tab refers to. I want to make sure that when this code executes in [Edit Record VC] that it will force tab to pop back to the root view even though the code executes on its own tab: [ ---------------TAB BAR CONTROLLER ------------------ ] TAB 0 TAB 1 TAB 2 TAB 3 | | | | | | | | [NAV CONTR 0] [NAV CONTR 1] [NAV CONTR 2] [NAV CONTR 3] | | | | [Table VC] [Map VC] \ / \ / \ / [View Record VC] | | [Edit Record VC]  In the above drawing when I delete a record in [Edit Record VC] I want to pop Nav Controller 1 and Nav Controller 2 to the very first VC. How can I do this? I have tried every way I can think of and the code just isn't working. The reason I want to do this is because if NAV CONTR 2 navigates to [Edit Record VC] and deletes the record [View Record VC] will still be referencing that record causing it to point to a deleted object. When I try to open the NAV CONTR 2 tab after deletion it'll cause a crash
13635303,jquery,I am wondering if calling the same slider object twice (or more) creates two different objects? Do I need to first destroy the original before calling the other? How do I check if two slider objects exists using Firebug/Chrome console? html: <div id='test-slider'></div>  javascript: $('#test-slider').slider({ value: test_value min: 0 max: 10 step: 1 }); $('#test-slider').slider({ value: test_value_2 min: 0 max: 100 step: 10 });  Thanks!
9214939,java|android,i'm currently having trouble to add dynamicly a marquer on my mapview certainly due to my lack in java knowledge :( which parameter should i give to my canvas to make this work? when i fee the coordinates the map goes where i want but i have no maker ((Button)findViewById(R.id.goMap)).setOnClickListener( new OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { mapView.invalidate(); // On récupère notre EditText EditText UserName = ((EditText)findViewById(R.id.getLon)); EditText Password = ((EditText)findViewById(R.id.getLat)); // On garde la chaîne de caractères _lat = UserName.getText().toString(); _long = Password.getText().toString(); latTest = Double.parseDouble(_lat)* 1E6; longTest = Double.parseDouble(_long)* 1E6; p3 = new GeoPoint( (int) (latTest ) (int) (longTest )); //---add the marker--- Bitmap bmp3 = BitmapFactory.decodeResource( getResources() R.drawable.maps_position_marker); Canvas canvas= new Canvas(); canvas.drawBitmap(bmp3 screenP3ts.x-15 screenP3ts.y-30 null); mapView.getProjection().toPixels(p3 screenP3ts); mapController.animateTo(p3); mapController.setCenter(p3); Toast.makeText(TheMap.this lat= + latTest + et + long= + longTest Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } });  in my intial code the overlay which has all good parametres it needs is loaded in the onCreate () methode and it works fine but as i mentioned i can't figure out how to add the marker in the onclick () methode. I know what i did is wrong but i don't know how to do :( thx in advance
31565031,ios,I am developing a small app that includes messenger functionality. When showing a chat thread obviously I used a tableView populate it with the messages in small bubbles and at some point before viewDidAppear scroll to the bottom so the most recent messages are shown.  There is a popular solution to scrolling to the bottom of a tableView with scrollToCellAtIndexPath or scrollRectToVisible. These kinda work with little data and constant cell heights. BUT in my case there is a lot of message data and I use UITableViewAutomaticDimensions for rowHeight. This results in slow loading not scrolling to the bottom and crazy error messages.  Here's why (IMO): To scroll to the bottom the tableView has to load all cells because they have automatic dimensions and can only scroll down after he knows how far it is. Auto layout is another problem. Sometimes it doesn't scroll all the way down because auto layout didn't finish yet and rowHeight is at the initial value still. What I tried: putting the scrolling in didLayoutSubviews: solves the problem but loads very slowly and scrolling is called multiple times (+ some crazy error message) I guess an upside down tableView would solve the problem because then the first cell could be the latest message and no scrolling would be needed.

17957522,php|html,I want to retrieve all the content in a div element in HTML. I am using PHP and XPath to do it. Here is the query: $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->loadHTMLFile($uri); $xpath= new DOMXPath($doc); $text_content = $xpath->query( /html/body/div[5]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[5]/* );  I used wild card * to retrieve all elements (normal text div img p etc.) under this div(div[5]) but when I printed the $text_content I found out that it only stored all the div elements.  What is the correct way to do so? Thanks in advance.
21035424,ios,I am learning NSPredicate and I have an example with problem. NSArray * array = @[@{@ name :@ KudoCC } @{@ name :@ 123 }] ; NSPredicate * predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@ name == '%@'  @123] ; NSArray * result = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate] ;  The parameter here is @123 it is NSNumber type.

17553452,ios,I am developing an iPhone app that has a custom nav bar. Here's the code that I have: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; UIImage *testNav = [UIImage imageNamed:@ Test Nav Bar 320 wide.png ]; [self.navigationController.navigationBar setBackgroundImage:testNav forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault]; }  When I Run the application it looks fine. However I also have a retina version of the nav bar. When I replace: @ Test Nav Bar 320 wide.png  with the retina graphic: @ Test Nav Bar 640 wide.png  the nav bar becomes way too big and runs off the screen. What am I doing wrong? Does it have something to do with the: forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault I'm fairly new to iOS development and any help would be most appreciated.
21558651,android,I am thinking to start the development of a new project and I have some ideas in mind but I am not sure how much is doable in android. The steps of the app would be:   The user selects a set of images from Gallery  The user selects an audio file from external storage  I combine the images and the sound (each image is displayed for a timeframe) into a movie file that can be exported to YouTube  From my research I wasn't able to find any way to create the movie. All the answers contained links to android NDK and external codecs. So my question is: which would be the easiest way of making this on android ?
33795809,android,I am trying to write an application to trigger the Android camera at a fixed given time interval. I was testing it with TimerTask however I read that I am not suppose to trigger the camera again until the JPEG is ready. Is there a method of triggering the camera at a fixed interval and letting the JPEG come when its ready and then trigger it again and let that next JPEG come when it's read etc without causing some sort of Heap Overflow? Is there a way to do this camera2? Here are the relevant methods I have so far: PictureCallback onPicTake=new PictureCallback() { @Override public void onPictureTaken ( byte[] bytes Camera camera){ Log.d( data size  +bytes.length); Log.d( taken  taken ); new SaveImageTask(getStorage()).execute(bytes); resetCam(); } }; Camera.ShutterCallback onShutter=new Camera.ShutterCallback() { @Override public void onShutter () { AudioManager mgr = (AudioManager) getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE); mgr.playSoundEffect(AudioManager.FLAG_PLAY_SOUND); } }; private class CameraTrigger extends TimerTask{ public void run(){ mCamera.takePicture(onShutter null onPicTake); } } preview.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View arg0) { timer = new Timer(); timer.schedule(new CameraTrigger() 0 1000); } }); private void resetCam() { mCamera.startPreview(); preview.setCamera(mCamera); }

5719100,javascript|jquery,I'm trying to modify a carousel with some manual navigation between slides . I've followed this guide. This is my result. Can anyone explain to me how I can make so it's possible to:   Choose the second slider (with the manual navigation) Step right using the arrow that points to right  Without being redirected back to the first slide . I understand that it's in the } else if (page > pages) {-case and it's resetting the page-variable. But how can I avoid it? I thought the goto-method was supposed to take care of the current page association. I've been doing this for hours and I'm just more confused.  (I know my workaround for the manual navigation is fugly ;) ) Thanks in advance!

17538276,jquery,I am having issues with my hover off function. For the most part the complete function works. I can hover the <li> to reveal the underlying <ul> as desired. The issue comes when the user hovers off the <li> to select the child <ul> and the links. As you can see the hover out function kicks in and negates the fact that the child <ul> is within the parent <li>  example of the issue: If you hover over the li and try to selecet the sub menu I have tried multiple CSS positioning and styles and have arrived here: nav { width:100%; height:50px; background:url(../assets/navBG.jpg) 0 0 repeat; position:relative; z-index:999; } ul.nav { list-style:none; position:absolute; } ul.nav li { float:left; font-family: 'PlayRegular'; font-size:18px; color:#fff; padding:13px 43px; background:url(../assets/navIcon.png) center right no-repeat; cursor:pointer; } ul.nav li > ul { position:absolute; display:none; list-style:none; width:100%; height:auto; top:50px; left:0; overflow:hidden; background:#000; }  I have worked with the Jquery to slideDown the child ul but cannot find a way to allow it to be hover-able  $( ul.nav li ).hover( function() { $(this).find( ul ).slideDown({ duration: 300 easing: linear  queue: false }); } function() { $(this).find( ul ).slideUp({ duration: 300 easing: linear  queue: false }); });  Am I missing something to allow the child <ul> to be considered part of the parent <li>? is it a Jquery or CSS issue? I know it is not an HTML issue because i am 100% sure I have written it semantically correct with no open <divs>

22961734,javascript|php|jquery,There is a ping.php file which is works great on its own: Ping the given host and shows the ping result immediately row by row on a web-page. But I would like to show the ping result in a jQuery Dialog box Similarly row_by_row. Here is the jQuery code:  $(function() { var tag = $( <div></div> ); $( #button ).on('click' function() { $.ajax({ url: /modules/ping.php?host=172.16.1.1  success: function(data) { tag.html(data).dialog({title: 'Ping' modal: false}).dialog('open'); } }); }); });  But in this case the Dialog box only appears (and show the result) when the ping.php Completed the run and I do not see the ping result row by row! This is not good. Is it possible to fix this?
28630414,python,The proper way to convert a unicode string u to a (byte)string in Python is by calling u.encode(someencoding). Unfortunately I didn't know that before and I had used str(u) for conversion. In particular I called str(u) to coerce u to be a string so that I can make it a valid shelve key (which must be a str). Since I didn't encounter any UnicodeEncodeError I wonder if this process is reversible/lossless. That is can I do u = str(converted_unicode) (or u = bytes(converted_unicode) in Python 3) to get the original u?

UPDATE: After some more tinkering I believe that the issue lies with my base64 encoding: req.putheader( Authorization  Basic %s % base64.b64encode(b'concat_consumer_url')) When I decode the resulting encoding of the above I get b'concat_consumer_url' rather than a concatenation of the encoded_CONSUMER_KEY and encoded_CONSUMER_SECRET combined around a colon. How do I get the base64 to b64encode the value that concat_comsumer_url represents rather than the string concat_consumer_url so that I can move forward? Thanks in advance.
17120761,html,I am working in the phonegap/android. I had to use an image which was of size 304 * 250. It is working perfectly in screen size of 320 * 480 and screen size of 720 * 1280. Now When I wanted to check the same in a screen size of 240 * 320 and screen size of 480 * 800? Neither the background images were to be seen nor the data value. Remedial step taken: I thought of using a box shadow instead of the image. I implemented it and tested it in screen size of 320 * 480.It was perfect. I thought of testing the same in the screen size of 240 * 320 and screen size of 480 * 800 using Media Query I referred from here and I tried implementing it But I was not successful.  @media only screen and (max-width:320px) { .container { width:180px; height:150px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; background-color:#CCCCCC; border-radius:20px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; padding:10px; } } @media only screen and (max-width:480px) { .container { width:250px; height:250px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; background-color:#CCCCCC; border-radius:20px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; padding:10px; top:5px min-height:200px; } }  I have added this too  <meta content='width=device-width initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0 user-scalable=0' name='viewport' />  My Problem My device with 320*480 width-480 takes the 2nd CSS @media only screen and (max-width:480px) but my device with 240*320 width-320 too takes the 2nd CSS.
27081513,javascript|html,I'm making a simple IDE for a educational programming language similar to Karel the Dog. And I have trouble with making base html page. I have 4 areas:  Toolbox (for buttons like open save as run etc.) Field (canvas for drawing executor that can move on the field and do some stuff) Code (CodeMirror editor for writing executor's commands) Console (place where IDE can print messages like compilation errors or runtime debug output)  I wrote what I want from every area in my code so I'll say only what is not working now:  The page should fill 100% screen's height. Cannot set CodeMirror to fill all available to its parent height. And when its size is greater than parent's height scrollbars should appear. The same problem with canvas - but only on vertical. Is there a way to make a separator between code and field areas that can be used to redistribute horizontal space between areas?  There is another difficulty. If the item number 4 requires JavaScript then I'll ask to help me with solving it with WinJS 3.0 library because I won't add to the project jQuery or other heavy stuff only for this resize capability. So can anyone help me? I loaded my code to jsfiddle.net and pasted it here:   var ce = CodeMirror(document.getElementById('b-codemirror') { value: \n\n\nIt is CodeMirror element. [PARAMS ALL] + width: 100% of parent element height: always 100% of + parent element + both scrollbars if needed\n\n\n  lineNumbers: true }); var cc = document.getElementById( canvas ).getContext( 2d ); cc.font = 16px Helvetica ; cc.fillText( It is canvas.

21220426,c++,EDIT: As I was reading this question after myself I figured it out. The root of the problem is most likely that I didn't allocate enough memory. I will try to think about this and do it correctly and then answer to my question. Silly me. :-[ It doesn't explain the warps not showing up in stdout though... Original question I created a templated kernel in CUDA in which I iterate over sections of grayscale image data in global memory (shared memory optimizations are due when I get this working) to achieve morphological operations with disc-shaped structure elements. Each thread corresponds to a pixel of the image. When the data type is char everything works as expected all my threads do what they should. When I change it to unsigned short it starts acting up and only computes the upper half of my image. When I put in some printfs (my device has 2.0 CC) I found out that some of the warps that should run aren't even computed. Here's the relevant code. From my main.cpp I call gcuda::ErodeGpuGray8(img radius); and gcuda::ErodeGpuGray16(img radius); which are the following functions: // gcuda.h … i3d::Image3d<i3d::GRAY8> ErodeGpuGray8(i3d::Image3d<i3d::GRAY8> img const unsigned int radius); i3d::Image3d<i3d::GRAY16> ErodeGpuGray16(i3d::Image3d<i3d::GRAY16> img const unsigned int radius); … // gcuda.cu … // call this from outside Image3d<GRAY8> ErodeGpuGray8(Image3d<GRAY8> img const unsigned int radius) { return ErodeGpu<GRAY8>(img radius); } // call this from outside Image3d<GRAY16> ErodeGpuGray16(Image3d<GRAY16> img const unsigned int radius) { return ErodeGpu<GRAY16>(img radius); } …  The library I'm using defines GRAY8 as char and GRAY16 as unsigned short. Here's how I call the kernel (blockSize is a const int set to 128 in the relevant namespace): // gcuda.cu template<typename T> Image3d<T> ErodeGpu(Image3d<T> img const unsigned int radius) { unsigned int width = img.GetWidth(); unsigned int height = img.GetHeight(); unsigned int w = nextHighestPower2(width); unsigned int h = nextHighestPower2(height); const size_t n = width * height; const size_t N = w * h; Image3d<T>* rslt = new Image3d<T>(img); T *vx = rslt->GetFirstVoxelAddr(); // kernel parameters dim3 dimBlock( blockSize ); dim3 dimGrid( ceil( N / (float)blockSize) ); // source voxel array on device (orig) T *vx_d; // result voxel array on device (for result of erosion) T *vxr1_d; // allocate memory on device gpuErrchk( cudaMalloc( (void**)&vx_d n ) ); gpuErrchk( cudaMemcpy( vx_d vx n cudaMemcpyHostToDevice ) ); gpuErrchk( cudaMalloc( (void**)&vxr1_d n ) ); gpuErrchk( cudaMemcpy( vxr1_d vx_d n cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice ) ); ErodeGpu<T><<<dimGrid dimBlock>>>(vx_d vxr1_d n width radius); gpuErrchk( cudaMemcpy( vx vxr1_d n cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost ) ); // free device memory gpuErrchk( cudaFree( vx_d ) ); gpuErrchk( cudaFree( vxr1_d ) ); // for debug purposes rslt->SaveImage( ../erodegpu.png ); return rslt; }  The dimensions of my testing image are 82x82 so n = 82*82 = 6724 and N = 128*128 = 16384. This is my kernel: // gcuda.cu // CUDA Kernel -- used for image erosion with a circular structure element of radius erosionR template<typename T> __global__ void ErodeGpu(const T *in T *out const unsigned int n const int width const int erosionR) { ErodeOrDilateCore<T>(ERODE in out n width erosionR); } // The core of erosion or dilation. Operation is determined by the first parameter template<typename T> __device__ void ErodeOrDilateCore(operation_t operation const T *in T *out const unsigned int n const int width const int radius) { // get thread number this method is overkill for my purposes but generally should be bulletproof right? int blockId = blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * gridDim.x + gridDim.x * gridDim.y * blockIdx.z; int threadId = blockId * (blockDim.x * blockDim.y * blockDim.z) + (threadIdx.z * (blockDim.x * blockDim.y)) + (threadIdx.y * blockDim.x) + threadIdx.x; int tx = threadId; if (tx >= n) { printf( [%d > %d]  tx n); return; } else { printf( {%d}  tx); } … (erosion implementation stdout is the same when this is commented out so it's probably not the root of the problem) }  To my understanding this code should write a randomly sorted set of [X > N] and {X} strings to stdout where X = thread ID and there should be n curly-bracketed numbers (i.e. the output of threads with the index < n) and N - n of the rest but when I run it and count the curly-bracketed numbers using a regex I find out that I only get 256 of them. Furthermore they seem to occur in 32-member groups which tells me that some warps are run and some are not. I am really baffled by this. It doesn't help that when I don't comment out the erosion implementation part the GRAY8 erosion works and the GRAY16 erosion doesn't even though the stdout output is exactly the same in both cases (could be input-dependent I only tried this with 2 images). What am I missing? What could be the cause of this? Is there some memory-management mistake on my part or is it fine that some warps don't run and the erosion stuff is possibly just a bug in the image library that only occurs with the GRAY16 type?

16912403,javascript|jquery,I have an a tag into a li and am appending few images on hover of a li into same a tag and I have to use inline style on all those img elements but the problem is when I hover first time on li these styles apply only on first img tag which is always exist there but not on others but if I hover over li again then those inline styles applies on all img tags. for this am using this JS code given below: $(document).ready(function() { var mouseover_interval; var $image; $('li.product-details').mouseenter(function() { current_image = -1; $image = $(this).find('a.current_product_image img'); data_srcs = $image.attr('data-srcs').split(  ); if(data_srcs.length >1){ for (var i = data_srcs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { img = new Image ; img.src = data_srcs[i]; new_img = $('<img>').attr('src' data_srcs[i]).css({display: none }).addClass( over ); $(this).find('a.current_product_image').append(new_img); var countImg = $(this).find('a.current_product_image img'); countImg.each(function(){ $(this).css({ position : 'absolute' left : '50%' marginLeft : -$(this).width()/2 top : '50%' marginTop : -$(this).height()/2 }); }); } } else{ return false; } $images = $(this).find('a.current_product_image img.over'); mouseover_interval = setInterval(function(){ { $image.fadeOut(500); if(current_image == -1){ $($images[$images.length-1]).fadeOut(500); } else{ $($images[current_image]).fadeOut(500); } current_image+=1; $($images[current_image]).fadeIn(500); if(current_image == $images.length-1){ current_image = -1; } } } 1000); }).mouseleave( function(){ clearInterval(mouseover_interval); $image.fadeIn(500); $(this).find('a.current_product_image img.over').remove(); }); });  How to add styles on all appended elements hovering over li first time? Please let me know if am using anything wrong there. Thanks in advance Ashwani Sharma
20620209,ios,I'm using AFNetworking 1.3.3 and running into an issue i'm unsure how to debug. Below is the stack trace. The issue so far only reproduce during unit test but that probably points to a design issue that will cause issue at some other random times so I want to figure it out. Below is the stack trace there is no output in the log and the app just stay there. It seems to me that the app is in dead lock but i can't figure out why it would be.  Edit: one detail i missed is that the execution pointed indicates: EXC_BAD_ACCESS(code = 1 address=xxxxxx)  Any pointers appreciated thanks olivier Thread 1 Queue : com.apple.main-thread #0 0x0409e0b2

15151148,python,Ugh another programming question guys haha. So anyways I became pretty interested in ctypes with python. ctypes basically allows you to call c variables within python (Awesome I know) so here is how you declare variables with ctypes now: import ctypes as c class test(c.Structure): _fields_ = [ ( example  c.c_long) ... ]  Here's the thing though whenever I use string formatting:  print( test: %d % (test.example)  it tells me that I needs it to be a Python Integer not a C long. Here's where it becomes complicated because example isn't really declared I can't do a .value method. It will return a syntax error. I can't declare example as a python integer because there is no way to do that. (at least as far as I know) Any help will be appreciated!
31084235,python,My goal is to create three subplots in same window. Those subplots should be aligned in one column each one under another.

How is this possible? ax[0].axis([pospos+10-11]) # ax[1].axis([pospos+10-11]) fig.canvas.draw_idle() spos.on_changed(update) plt.show()  Here are two different parts of code that I use for plotting this is the trial and error part of code that I do not understand: # 1st alternative - this plot is scrollable: ax[0].plot(x_time oscil k-  label= oscilation ) ax[0].legend() # 2nd alternative - this plot is not scrollable: plt.subplot(211) plt.plot(x_time oscil k-  label= oscilation ) plt.title('A tale of 2 subplots') plt.ylabel('Damped oscillation')  I've tried to combine those examples into my final solution (having three plots from which the two are scrollable). So I've changed nrows=2 to nrows=3 in following line: fig ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2 ncols=1 sharex=True sharey=False) But if I use 1st alternative then all three subplots are scrollable instead of two. And if I use 2nd alternative then I get just two subplots instead of three where one is scrollable and another is not. Can you please answer following questions:  comment regarding: plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.25) comment regarding: plt.axis([0 10 -1 1]) comment regarding: ax[0].axis([pospos+10-11]) vs ax[1].axis([pospos+10-11]) The most important: how to make it work for three subplots?

18676790,jquery,My logo on my website is a SVG. I have found some javascript that makes my inline SVG logo editable: /* * Replace all SVG images with inline SVG */ jQuery('img.svg').each(function(){ var $img = jQuery(this); var imgID = $img.attr('id'); var imgClass = $img.attr('class'); var imgURL = $img.attr('src'); jQuery.get(imgURL function(data) { // Get the SVG tag ignore the rest var $svg = jQuery(data).find('svg'); // Add replaced image's ID to the new SVG if(typeof imgID !== 'undefined') { $svg = $svg.attr('id' imgID); } // Add replaced image's classes to the new SVG if(typeof imgClass !== 'undefined') { $svg = $svg.attr('class' imgClass+' replaced-svg'); } // Remove any invalid XML tags as per http://validator.w3.org $svg = $svg.removeAttr('xmlns:a'); // Replace image with new SVG $img.replaceWith($svg); } 'xml'); });  Now that I can change the color with css is it then possible to use it with the jQuery plugin skrollr: https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr/tree/master/examples so I can change the color of the logo when scrolling down? I was trying to add this to SVG but it didn't work: data-0= fill:rgb(25500); data-500= fill:rgb(00255);  Below is the fiddle for it. http://jsfiddle.net/NEhmK/1/

4344984,javascript|jquery,I have an array of hashes in Javascript which I need to send as a parameter in a jQuery.get() request. I've tried this: $.get('../notes/notes_temp_path'{temp_param:notes_array} function(data) { console.log( done ); });  but the server doesn't get the temp_param parameter. What do I need to do?

25288498,php|jquery,I am implementing a photos management system using codeigniter. I am stuck on the below problem I have a page which consists of comments made by different people on a particular photo. Other people can like those comments. HTML View: <div class= container > <?php foreach($comments as $comment):?> <div class= row style= margin-bottom:0 > <div class= col-sm-4 col-xs-12 comment > <p><?php echo ucfirst($comment['username'])?> says</p> <p class= content ><?=$comment['comment']?></p> <p>on <?=$comment['date_time']?></p> <!-- above display info about the comment --> </div> </div> <!-- likes --> <div class= row style= margin-top:0 > <input hidden= name='comment_id' class= comment_id name= comment_id value= <?php echo $comment['id'];?> > <input hidden= name= user_id class= user_id name= user_id value= <?php echo $this->session->userdata['logged_in']['id']?> > <span class= glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up like style= margin-right: 5px;cursor: pointer ></span><span class= like-count style= margin-right: 15px ></span> </div> <?php endforeach;?> </div>  I need to display total likes made by each person on a particular comment. (For example in facebook we see there are 90 likes and so on..) jQuery: This is my ajax call which is also in the same view. $(function(){ //Document is now ready $( .like ).each(function(){ var comment_id=$(this).siblings( .comment_id ).val(); //Getting comment id $.ajax({ method: POST  url: <?php echo site_url('viewer/display_likes_count');?>  data: comment_id= +comment_id success:function(data){ $( .like-count ).html(data); //updating total counts } }); }); });  Controller:  public function display_likes_count(){ $comment_id= $this->input->post( comment_id ); $result= $this->Viewer_model->count_likes($comment_id); echo $result['likes_count']; }  Model:  public function count_likes($comment_id){ $this->db->select( COUNT(*) AS likes_count ); $this->db->from( likes ); $this->db->where( comment_id  $comment_id); $result= $this->db->get(); return $result->row_array(); }  When I load a particular photo all the comments hold 0 total likes but actually there are different numbers of likes in the db for each comment Note - I did alert data in my success function. Then results that I wanted get alerted properly but when I update like-count span it says 0. Why is that. am not I selecting the elemnts properly using jQuery. I tried $(this).siblings( .like-count ).html(data); but still the result for all the comments is 0.  Please show me where I have gone wrong ?
13958844,python,I find myself needing to specify a timespan in a python configuration file a lot.  Is there a way that I can specify a more human readable timeframe (similar to PostgreSQL's Interval syntax) in a python configuration file with stdlib? Or will this require a 3rd party lib? Clarification I'm not looking for anything in the ConfigParser.ConfigParser stdlib API specifically. I guess what I really need is a way to go from human readable date/time interval to datetime.timedelta value.

21148400,html,I've noticed that the borders for my links do not cover 100% of the navbar height. Either it is one pixel too short at padding:10px; or it is one pixel too long at padding:11px; (which to me makes absolutely no sense) Link to fiddle <nav class= bg > <div class= navwrap width > <div class= nav ><div class= navLeft ></div><a href= # >Link</a><a href= # >Link</a><a href= # >Link</a><div class= navRight ></div></div> </div> </nav>  CSS: .width{margin:0 auto;min-width:1000px;width:84%;} nav{border-top:1px solid #BBB;border-bottom:1px solid #BBB;} .navwrap{display:flex;flex-flow:row-wrap;padding:10px 0;font-weight:bold;color:#FFF;} .nav{flex:1;} .navLeft.navRight{display:inline;padding:10px 0;} .navLeft{border-right:1px solid #555;} .navRight{border-left:1px solid #000;} .nav a{padding:10px;background:rgba(0000);transition:background-color 0.2s linear;border-left:1px solid #000;border-right:1px solid #555;} .nav a:hover{background:rgba(002551);}  Also while I've been using pixels to set the height how can I use 100% instead? I'm sure that would solve the problem but when I do it the padding and rollover background colour becomes 100% of page height.

21787969,ios,How do I set a size for a SKTexture Ive gone through the documentation Class Reference I don't see anything about being able to set the size. I know the size method is a return method but just to make it clear what I'm trying to do its in my code below.  _bomb = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@ Bomb5.gif ]; SKTexture *Bomb5 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ Bomb5.gif ]; Bomb5.size = CGSizeMake(40 40); SKTexture *Bomb4 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ Bomb4.gif ]; Bomb4.size = CGSizeMake(40 40); SKTexture *Bomb3 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ Bomb3.gif ]; Bomb3.size = CGSizeMake(40 40); SKTexture *Bomb2 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ Bomb2.gif ]; Bomb2.size = CGSizeMake(40 40); SKTexture *Bomb1 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ Bomb1.gif ]; Bomb1.size = CGSizeMake(40 40); SKTexture *explostion = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@ explosionnn.gif ]; explostion.size = CGSizeMake(90 90); //5 second countdown and the bomb explodes countdown = [SKAction animateWithTextures:@[Bomb5Bomb4 Bomb3 Bomb2 Bomb1 explostion] timePerFrame:1];  Another solution?: Maybe I could add actions in sequence where after the 5 second countdown I can change the size of the spriteNode instead when it reaches the last animation image. But if I were to do it this way how do I change the size of the image from the centre origin of where the bomb is?

6850409,python,the problem is: I have a local directory '/local' and a remote FTP directory '/remote' full of subdirectories and files. I want to check if there are any new files in the sub-directories of '/remote'. If there are any then copy them over to '/local'. the question is: am I using the right strategy? Is this totally overkill and is there a much faster pythonic way to do it? DISCLAIMER: I'm a python n00b trying to learn. So be gentle ... =) This is what I've tried: Create a list of all files in /local and its sub-dirs. LocalFiles=[] for path subdirs files in os.walk(localdir): for name in files: LocalFiles.append(name)  Do some ftplib magic using ftpwalk() and copying its results to a list of the form:  RemoteFiles=[['/remote/dir1/''/remote/dir1/''/remote/dir3/']['file1.txt''file12.py''file3.zip']]  so I have the directory corresponding to each file. Then see which files are missing by comparing the lists of filenames missing_files= list(set(RemoteFiles[1]) - set(LocalFiles))  and once I've found their name I try to find the directory that came with that name for i in range(0len(missing_files)): theindex=RemoteFiles[1].index(missing_files[i])  which lets me build the list of missing files and their directories MissingDirNFiles.append([remotefiles[0][theindex]remotefiles[1][theindex]])  so I can copy them over with ftp.retrbinary. Is this a reasonable strategy? Any tips comments and advice is appreciated [especially for large numbers of files].
21450845,javascript|html,I'm a beginner in web dev. I apologize beforehand if my diction is not programmer-standard.  Here is what I'm trying to achieve: 1. multiple divs that can take any height. In this example one has the height of the viewport and the other one is taller (2000px). 2. 'body' element acts as the wrapper which has a linear-gradient background that covers all divs areas.  Using some borders I can see that the 'body' sizes itself accordingly to the 'div's inside it. However the gradient stops on the viewport height. Note: If I switch to a flat color it works.  Here is my HTML (much simplified but the point is still valid):    html { font-family: 'Exo 2' sans-serif; font-size: medium; margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100%; min-height: 100%; } body { background: linear-gradient(to bottom rgba(192 196 203 1) rgba(42 43 44 1)); background-repeat: no-repeat; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: 5px solid gold; /*just for visualizing area*/ } #box1 { width: 100%; height: 100vh; /*viewport height something I recently tried as an attempt to solve the problem*/ border: 5px solid red; /*just for visualizing area*/ } #box2 { width: 100%; height: 2000px; border: 5px solid red; /*just for visualizing area*/ } <html> <head> <link rel= stylesheet type= text/css href= Style/mystyle.css > </head> <body> <div id= box1 ></div> <div id='box2'></div> </body> </html>   
10962753,ios,In my iPad app I have a AdBannerView and I need to present a popover. If I do so it throws the warning saying that the banner could be hidden: infact even if the banner is not actually hidden the user can NOT click on it because the tap would be intercepted by the popover (so the tap will have the effect of closing the popover not opening the advertisement). It turns out that making the ad hidden b4 presenting the popover and show it again after the popover is gone removes the warning. (of course it does the ad is not visible anymore!) But how does this work? If I hide the banner and then I show it again do I still get the revenue for it? And is there any better solution to this problem?
14866296,python,I am building my first app with Flask Python micro-framework and I have a problem with committing my models to the database. When I test my User model on the command line all works well. But when I do a db.session.commit() I have error 1146 : Table doesn't exist.  I'm using a MySQL database in local mode and there is no error with login/password Maybe I'm doing it wrong on the configuration or something else.

24938716,jquery,I seem to be having a problem specifically with Safari where the video refuses to play and instead plays just the audio.  The code is pretty straightforward  <video id= bgvid preload= auto > <source src= video.m4v type= video/mp4 /> <source src= video.webm type= video/webm /> <source src= video.ogv type= video/ogg /> </video>  The other strange thing is if I browse directly to the video it plays fine. Any ideas?

For more background info please see here first: UIWebview manipulating SVG 'on the fly' Now I am trying to create SVG on the fly within the same frame work. I have tried using the createElementNS method in Javascript without success. Here is my failed attempt: NSString *string = @ var svgDocument=document.getElementById('circle').getSVGDocument();var shape=svgDocument.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' 'greencircle');shape.setAttributeNS(null 'cx' 25);shape.setAttributeNS(null 'cy' 25);shape.setAttributeNS(null 'r' 20);shape.setAttributeNS(null 'fill' 'green');svgDocument.appendChild(shape); ; [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:string];  Could somebody please show me an example of how to create a simple circle with a similar approach as above. Or if there is a better way to create SVG graphics on the fly then I'd love to know! Thanks.
19055703,javascript|jquery,I have this code $(document).ready(function () { var d = new Date(); var newMinutes = d.getTimezoneOffset(); var storedMinutes = getCookieValue( tzom ); if (newMinutes != storedMinutes) { setCookie( tzom  newMinutes); alert( new + newMinutes); alert( stored + storedMinutes); document.location.reload(true); } });  What I'm trying to do here is check a timezone value in a cookie to see if it is different to the current timezone set by the user. This will happen if I user comes to the site and changes their timezone and then goes to another page. If there is a difference then I set the cookie with the new value and reload the page. The problem is that when I reload the page it still shows that there is a difference in the timezones and so the page reloads in an infinite loop. If I am somehow able to click on a different page during this infinite loop then the looping stops. In fact what I have noticed by taking out the reload is that after changing my timezone if I click on a page the timezone is reported to be different if I then click on a second page the timezone still is reported to be different and it is only on the third page click that there is no reporting of the cookies being different. What is wrong here? EDIT Rest of the code is here function getCookieValue(c_name) { var c_value = document.cookie; var c_start = c_value.indexOf( + c_name + = ); if (c_start == -1) { c_start = c_value.indexOf(c_name + = ); } if (c_start == -1) { c_value = null; } else { c_start = c_value.indexOf( =  c_start) + 1; var c_end = c_value.indexOf( ;  c_start); if (c_end == -1) { c_end = c_value.length; } c_value = unescape(c_value.substring(c_start c_end)); } return c_value; } function setCookie(c_name value exdays) { var exdate = new Date(); exdate.setDate(exdate.getDate() + exdays); var c_value = escape(value) + ((exdays == null) ? : ; expires= + exdate.toUTCString()); document.cookie = c_name + = + c_value; }

17105401,ios,I have simple UIButton with two states. I added an action to the button for UIControlEventTouchDown event. When button is in normal state all works great method is called when I touch the button. But when button is in selected state nothing happens when I touch button only when I release finger the state changes to normal (Like UIControlEventTouchUpInside). How can I solve this? I create my button using this method: - (UIButton *) createButtonWithFrame:(CGRect)frame title:(NSString *)title { UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; [button setFrame:frame]; [button setTitle:title forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [button setTitleColor:UIColorFromRGB(0x3a3a3a) forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [button setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateSelected]; [[button titleLabel] setFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@ Gotham-Bold size:10]]; [button setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@ button.png ] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [button setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@ button_pressed.png ] forState:(UIControlStateSelected)]; [button setAdjustsImageWhenHighlighted:NO]; [button addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown]; return button; }  And buttonPressed: is like this: - (void) buttonPressed:(UIButton *)sender { [sender setSelected:!sender.selected]; }

36869494,jquery|html,Using a glyph library like Font Awesome buttons often end up looking something like this: <button> <span class= fa fa-stack-overflow fa-lg ></span> Click me </button>  When handling a button event the target can be either the span or the button itself depending on where the user clicks so I normally end up with something like this: $('button').on('click' function($event) { var $target = $($event.target); var $button = $target.is('button') ? $target : $target.closest('button'); // useful stuff goes here }  Is it possible to extend the jQuery event object to add a method that encapsulates this functionality so it can be called like this? var $button = $event.getSpecificTarget('button');  I've created a JSFiddle to demonstrate the issue. It could be done using a normal jQuery plugin but it would feel cleaner if it could be accessed straight from the event object rather than via a plugin like this: var $button = $.getSpecificTarget($event 'button'); 
36675419,ios,I have a UItextView which I place images and type text into and once I have finished with the TextView I then upload the contents of that textView to Parse. If I only add 1 image to the textView it lets me upload the UITextView contents to Parse without any problems but when I add more than 1 Image I get the error data is larger than 10mb etc... . Now I am wondering how I can reduce the size of this PFFile? Or is their a way to reduce the size of the images before or after adding the to the textView? possibly extract the from th etextView and reduce there size before uploading to Parse? This is my code: Here is where the text & images from the textView are stored: var recievedText = NSAttributedString()  And here Is how I upload it to Parse: let post = PFObject(className: Posts ) let uuid = NSUUID().UUIDString post[ username ] = PFUser.currentUser()!.username! post[ titlePost ] = recievedTitle let data: NSData = NSKeyedArchiver.archivedDataWithRootObject(recievedText) post[ textPost ] = PFFile(name: text.txt  data:data) post[ uuid ] = \(PFUser.currentUser()!.username!) \(uuid) if PFUser.currentUser()?.valueForKey( profilePicture ) != nil { post[ profilePicture ] = PFUser.currentUser()!.valueForKey( profilePicture ) as! PFFile } post.saveInBackgroundWithBlock ({(success:Bool error:NSError?) -> Void in })  Best regards. How I add the images image1.image = images[1].imageWithBorder(40) let oldWidth1 = image1.image!.size.width; let scaleFactor1 = oldWidth1 / (blogText.frame.size.width - 10 ) image1.image = UIImage(CGImage: image1.image!.CGImage! scale: scaleFactor1 orientation: .Up) let attString1 = NSAttributedString(attachment: image1) blogText.textStorage.insertAttributedString(attString1 atIndex: blogText.selectedRange.location)

37240564,ios,I am using SceneKit on a game. At a certain point I need to show a menu. The menu has a background buttons and texts as expected from a menu. Suppose this menu was created using UIKit. If that was the case the background image would have lead/trailing/top/bottom constraints to glue each side to a side of the screen. How do I do that using SceneKit? I want the background to attach to the four sides of the screen independently of the screen size (iPhone 4 5 6 6+). To easy things the camera is orthographic when the menu shows. I guess the method would involve positioning the camera so its sides fit the background polygon. Or if not possible a way to calculate the size a plane that is on a certain xyz must have to be completely filling the screen. Everything must be done with SceneKit. No UIKit. Is there a way to do that? NOTE: The whole menu is created in SceneKit.
36268000,javascript|jquery|html,I'm trying to iterate over a group of <select> objects. For each one I need to add a series of <option> tags to it. These options allow the user to select a color that will be stored in a database. As an aside I'm using the bootstrap-select plugin to handle styling of the <select> objects but I don't think that this is relevant to my post. The array of <option> tags is learned from a group of hidden fields that is loaded at run time from the database. Thus it is not known until then so all of this has to happen dynamically. Each of those hidden fields belongs to the class 'color_list' so iteration is very easy. My code works insofar as I am able to update the <select> objects correctly. However my code also seems to be duplicating these <option> tags after the <select> tag is closed which screws up my DOM. A picture is worth a thousand words right?   Notice how each individual <option> tag is repeated once inside the <select> tag (correct) and again outside of it (incorrect)? The tags that are added outside of the <select> tag are actually adding new color blocks below the drop down list. In my jQuery code I am only appending it a single time so I don't know why this is happening. function updateColorPickers() { // iterate over each color picker $( .colorpicker ).each(function(i picker) { // and add each color as an option to it $( .color_list ).each(function(j elem) { var str = <option class='color_opt' style='background: ; str += $(elem).val(); str += '> ; str += $(elem).val(); str += </option> ; $(picker).append(str); }); $(picker).selectpicker('refresh'); }); }

35472631,html,Just started working on mobile responsive design for a site I'm working on. During testing I noticed the main tabs that link to different views of the site which can normally can be clicked with no problem on desktop barely responds when tapped on a phone or in the browser developer tools that simulate a tap. If I click it repeatedly then it will eventually register but it's not exactly user friendly. You can see what I'm talking about if you go to www.runnercalculator.com and click between the two tabs on the normal desktop view and then inspect and tap it in mobile.  What is different between a tap and a click that I'm not accounting for here? How can I make a view link work as a one tap click for mobile?

12927202,python,This should be a simple one. I am building a google app engine app. It makes a list of forms dyanmically using a list of entities called blocks. The blocks have various properties the labels on the radio buttons the size of the text area that kind of thing. I iterate over a list of these blocks in a jinja template picking out the particulars of the form from the properties of that particular block. That all works fine. However I would like to include a unique identifier for the block entity that I am using to build the form within the form. That will give me an efficient way of knowing what my user is responding to when he sends me a response. I tried:  <form> <input type= hidden name= qKey value= {{block.id}} >   That returns the following to my browser:   <form> <input type= hidden name= qKey value= >   Then I tried:   <form> <input type= hidden name= qKey value= {{block.key}} >   That returned:  <form> <input type= hidden name= qKey value= <bound method Block.key of <dynamicsurvey2.Block object at 0x10a092f10>> >   Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

19746490,javascript|jquery|html,I Have a map of Europe and a JSON file. The JSON file shows the unemployment rate for the year 2011 of each country. Also in the JSON file there are x and y elements so I can place a blue circle on top of each country in the map.  What I'm trying to do is when I hover over one of those circles(which is a country) is to grab it's unemployment rate from the JSON file an display it. My question is how can I grab the 'rate' element from the specific country I'm hovering over in the map from my JSON file?

22897353,ios,In a chess game I would like to use a 2-dimensional array to track positions of pieces at the chess board. Initially I thought to create an NSMuteableArray and indicate unoccupied squares by nil. The occupied slots should hold a pointer to a Piece object... However the following code: NSMutableArray* _board; ... _board = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) { NSMutableArray *row = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) { [row addObject:nil]; } [_board addObject:row]; }  fails with the runtime error: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException' reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil'  So nil can't be passed as argument to addObject... what to do here instead?

3931386,python,I'm new to tkinter and I was wondering if I can display a sequence of widgets on the same row instead of placing them one below the other one in a column.

25799013,c++,enum { WITH_ZERO }; auto copy_num = [](int n char target[NUM_LEN]) -> int { char temp; for (int j = NUM_LEN - 1; j >= 0; j--) { if ((temp = n % 10 + '0') == '0') { return WITH_ZERO; } else { target[j] = temp; n /= 10; } } return !WITH_ZERO; }; if (copy_num(i num_copy) == WITH_ZERO) { continue; } if (i * 3 > MAX_NUM) { continue; } copy_num(i * 2 num_double); copy_num(i * 3 num_triple);  //edit: changed 'goto' to 'continue' The above is part of my code which should show in what cases I would prefer to use nested lambdas. I can achieve similar to this with macros but they do make my codes dirtier while the lambdas used this way look more clean without the '\'s. The 'copy_num' function here is only used locally and not anywhere else so this has more readability than when defining 'copy_num' as a normal function outside. Lambdas can also conveniently catch outer variables if needed in which case I can reduce repetitive function parameters again making clearer code. By using lambdas this way several times I wondered whether it is a good or bad idea to use lambdas as an entire replacement to functions. Lambdas can work perfectly well as a more flexible form of functions possible to be nested or anonymous. In cases where what the lambdas do are of no difference than what a normal function of a same form would do the compiler will be smart enough to compile them as if being plain functions. Or perhaps future c/c++ will allow nested functions in general?
23776519,jquery|html,I have two .html files in my jQuery Mobile app directory (myapp/html/...) .In main.html i have a page which i declared as: <!--Home page--> <div data-role= page id= home > ... </div>  and in the second .html file which is just a login page i have a button which i want to wire to the home page in main.html. I have tried: <link href= html/main.html />  and then: <ul data-role= listview data-theme= b data-inset= true > <li><a href= html/main.html/home >Login</a></li> </ul>  but i get an error message saying  error loading page . I have also tried adding # just before home in the link but then the error message doesn't even show. I know that in normal html if the two html files are in the same folder all i have to do is <a href= thefile.html >my link</a>  But since one html file has several pages embedded in it in jQuery Mobile how do i do this?

The problem is when I release the shift key ( or just press the shift key) it decreases the size value by 1. Why?   Also if I put all these code into a main function:  def main(): import turtle ... ... ... wn.onkey(addsize'+') ... ... wn.mainloop() main()  A error message show up: NameError: name 'size' is not defined  I had called 'size' a global variable but why it is not defined now?

We have observed that whenever [nsnetservice addresses] returns IPV6 address replication is not suuccesful. We get the IPV4 address only when bluetooth is switched on randomly i.e 1 out of 5 times. In addition [NSNetService addresses] returns only one address from the array. Is it possible in some way to convert IPV6 address to IPV4 address or else retrieve the IPV4 address always?

30311042,javascript|html,I have an Ionic-framework app that has a list of messages. There are 4 types of messages and depending on the type the message should be displayed on the list with a particular color in the left border. The question is how do I indicate the CSS color depending on the type of message? The HTML looks like this: <ion-content class= ionc > <ion-list class= list > <ion-item ng-repeat= mensaje in mensajes class= listitem ng-click= abrirMensaje($index) on-hold= mostrarMenu(mensaje $index) > <h2><b>{{ mensaje.hid }}</b></h2> <h3>{{ mensaje.alert }}</h3> <p class= cont >{{ mensaje.mens }}</p> <p class= fecha >{{ mensaje.fecha }}</p> </ion-item> </ion-list>   The CSS looks like this if I fix every message to have the same color (red): .buzon-page .item-complex .item-content .listitem { border: 4px; border-left-style: solid !important; border-left-color: red !important; }  How can I change CSS coloring dynamically with AngularJS? UPDATE After modifying the code with the help of the first answer the color borders appear but they do not move with the items that should as they have an ion-option-button applied to them. This is the new HTML: <ion-content class= ionc > <ion-list class= list > <ion-item ng-repeat= mensaje in mensajes ng-class= mensaje.tipo == 'Promocion' ? 'clasePromocion': mensaje.tipo == 'Aprobado' ? 'claseAprobado' : mensaje.tipo == 'Alerta' ? 'claseAlerta' : mensaje.tipo == 'ATM' ? 'claseATM' : 'default' ng-click= abrirMensaje($index) on-hold= mostrarMenu(mensaje $index) item= item class= item-remove-animate > <h2><b>{{ mensaje.hid }}</b></h2> <h3>{{ mensaje.alert }}</h3> <p class= cont >{{ mensaje.mens }}</p> <p class= fecha >{{ mensaje.fecha }}</p> <ion-option-button class= button-positive ng-click= mostrarMenuComp($index) > Compartir </ion-option-button> <ion-option-button class= button-assertive ng-click= mostrarMenuElim($index) > Eliminar </ion-option-button> </ion-item> </ion-list>   And this is the new CSS: .clasePromocion { border-left: solid 6px #0078ff !important; /* azul */ } .claseAprobado { border-left: solid 6px #faaf40 !important; /* amarillo */ } .claseAlerta { border-left: solid 6px #ee4036 !important; /* rojo */ } .claseATM { border-left: solid 6px #00a551 !important; /* verde */ } .default { border-left: solid 6px white !important; /* blanco por defecto */ }  So the issue now is how to make the color borders move with the list items? Here is a capture of the problem: http://i57.tinypic.com/2r71o5c.jpg
3940057,python,I'm trying to create automated integration tests for this hardware+software test subject which runs a SNMP agent as it's command interface. Our test setup looks like this: We're using Fitnesse as a test runner and PyFit to be able to write the tests in Python. We then use netsnmp with Python bindings to send SNMP commands. This works pretty well. However when I try to run a suite the SNMP agent (the test subject) is restarted (and usually at a different simulated time) which makes the internals of netsnmp get all sorts of interesting errors. Turns out there is a lot of global state stored inside the netsnmp library like community and context names and problematically EngineTime and EngineBootCnt which is used to prevent replay attacks in SNMP v3. This causes the agent to reject my snmp commands. My problems is how do I reinitialise the netsnmp library (from the Python bindings) in a way that the internal global state are reset? The netsnmp.Session object in the Python bindings do take the parameter EngineTime and EngineBoots and setting them to 0 should reset them but actually it doesn't seem to do that. I also do not know if there is other global state in there which needs to be reset. I'm at a point where I think I need to rewrite the tests to use the pure python snmp library pysnmp but I was hoping to avoid it.
29504968,python,I am working off of a Miguel Grinberg tutorial on social authentication.  On the homepage template I have this code and I removed the twitter portion from the tutorial:  <h2>I don't know you!</h2> <p><a href= {{ url_for('oauth_authorize' provider='facebook') }} >Login with Facebook</a></p> {% endif %}  So when you click that link you pass Facebook as the provider through this view function: @app.route('/authorize/<provider>') def oauth_authorize(provider): if not current_user.is_anonymous(): return redirect(url_for('index')) oauth = OAuthSignIn.get_provider(provider) return oauth.authorize()  Now in a different file oauth.py I have the following and my issue is this. I keep getting an error when I click the Facebook link UNLESS the TwitterSignIn class is removed. I guess I am curious as to why the TwitterSignIn class needs to be removed for this to work because no data is being passed to it right?

14843195,ios,I’m trying toggle visibility between two sections (views) within a scrollview (that gets triggered by a segment control) the thing is I don’t want a gap where the hidden element was. Currently what I’m doing is in ViewDidAppear I’m storing the two views frame and then when I need to toggle the visibility of the views I’m setting the view that I want to hide’s frame to CGRecZero and moving the other view into the “top” position by setting it’s frame to its initial frame and modifying its origin.y property. The problem is that as soon as I scroll the view’s frames seem to get reset and I’m left with a gap. Here's an example of my code if (control.selectedSegmentIndex == 0) { [self.firstView setHidden:YES]; [self.firstView setFrame:CGRectZero]; [self.secondView setHidden:NO]; CGRect frmTmp = secondViewRec; frmTmp.origin.y = orgPoint.y; [self.secondView setFrame:frmTmp]; } else { [self.secondView setHidden:YES]; self.secondView.frame = CGRectZero; [self.firstView setHidden:NO]; CGRect frmTmp = firstViewRec; firstViewRec.origin.y = orgPoint.y; self.firstView.frame = frmTmp; }  I’m not set on using a scrollview directly I have also tried using a Static UITableView and hiding the cells but I was again left with gaps in the interface which is I why I’m trying this approach. Any suggestions? Is there perhaps an easier way to implement this?
30999831,python,In matplotlib how could I combine a series of X-Y values (each of them being for example in an array or list) to be plotted together many times later (with other elements this is a general pattern over which different things are to be plotted)? I would like to compute/extract them once then combine them in a single object/shape to be plotted properly in one command instead of always having to plot them separately: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy # Simple example numpy.random.seed(4) x = range(10) y = numpy.random.rand(10) # Create three 'lines' (here as x-y arrays) with different lenghts a = numpy.array((x y*10)).T b = numpy.array((x[:5]*y[:5] y[:5]**2)).T c = numpy.array((x[3:7] x[3:7])).T # Combine a b and c in one object to be called many times later # (this is not a good way to do that) abc = numpy.concatenate((a b c)) # Plot fig = plt.figure(figsize=(93)) ax0 = fig.add_subplot(131) ax0.plot(a[:0] a[:1] color='b') ax0.plot(b[:0] b[:1] color='r') ax0.plot(c[:0] c[:1] color='g') ax0.set_title( 3 lines to be combined ) ax1 = fig.add_subplot(132) ax1.plot(a[:0] a[:1] color='b') ax1.plot(b[:0] b[:1] color='b') ax1.plot(c[:0] c[:1] color='b') ax1.set_title( Desired output ) ax2 = fig.add_subplot(133) ax2.plot(abc[:0] abc[:1] color='b') # 1-line command ax2.set_title( Wrong (spaghetti plot) )   EDIT  Tom's answer solves my problem nicely building up on my attempt above (i.e. concantenate in a single array). Any other solution with a different approach remains welcome to learn something new (e.g. is it possible to build a single matplotlib object (an Artist or so)?).

27432240,c++,I'm trying to find the max number of nodes in a tree that is defined as follows: The root can have at most 2 children. Each subtree on the left can have at most L children. Each subtree on the right can have at most R children. I know the formula for finding the number nodes in a binary tree is 2^h-1 where h is the amount of levels in the tree.

Things I've already tried (that don't work):  Position relative on the svg and g elements. overflow: visible (would be more of a hack than a solution) wrapping the svg in a clearfix div  I would prefer a solution opposed to a hack like translate the g elements down by 20 each...   #chart{ width:100%;} #chart rect { fill: steelblue; } #chart text.value { fill: white; font-size: 10px; text-anchor: end; } #chart text.value2 { fill: white; font-size: 12px; } #chart text.label { fill: black; font-size: 20px; } <svg id= chart width= 908 height= 375 > <g transform= translate(00) > <text class= label x= 0 y= 0 >test 1</text> <rect x= 0 y= 10 width= 314.3076923076923 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 309.3076923076923 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >25</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >a</text> <rect x= 0 y= 38 width= 440.03076923076924 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 435.03076923076924 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >35</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >b</text> <rect x= 0 y= 66 width= 326.88000000000005 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 321.88000000000005 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >26</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >c</text> </g> <g transform= translate(0119) > <text class= label x= 0 y= 0 >test 2</text> <rect x= 0 y= 10 width= 377.1692307692308 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 372.1692307692308 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >30</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >a</text> <rect x= 0 y= 38 width= 502.8923076923077 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 497.8923076923077 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >40</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >b</text> <rect x= 0 y= 66 width= 628.6153846153846 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 623.6153846153846 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >50</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >c</text> </g> <g transform= translate(0238) > <text class= label x= 0 y= 0 >test 3</text> <rect x= 0 y= 10 width= 565.7538461538462 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 560.7538461538462 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >45</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 22.5 dy= .35em >a</text> <rect x= 0 y= 38 width= 817.2 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 812.2 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >65</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 50.5 dy= .35em >b</text> <rect x= 0 y= 66 width= 477.7476923076924 height= 25 ></rect> <text class= value x= 472.7476923076924 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >38</text> <text class= value2 x= 10 y= 78.5 dy= .35em >c</text> </g> </svg>

18974612,c++,How to avoid dangling reference in array subscription operator in some vector implementation below? If realloc changes the pointer then references previously obtained from operator[] are no longer valid. I cannot use new/delete for this. I have to use malloc/realloc/free. template <class T> class Vector { public: typedef size_t size_type_; ... T& operator[] (const size_type_); void push_back (const T&); ... private: const size_type_ page_size_; size_type_ size_; size_type_ capacity_; T* buffer_; }; template<class T> inline T& some_namespace::Vector<T>::operator[] (const size_type_ index) { ASSERT(index < size_); return buffer_[index]; } template<class T> inline void some_namespace::Vector<T>::push_back(const T& val) { if (size_ >= capacity_) { capacity_ += page_size_; T* temp = (T*)(realloc(buffer_ capacity_*sizeof(T))); if (temp != NULL) { buffer_ = temp; } else { free(buffer_); throw some_namespace::UnexpectedEvent(); } } buffer_[size_++] = val; }  By the way the source of dangling reference in the code was this: v_.push_back(v_[id]);  where v_ is an instance of Vector. To guard against this the new push_back is: template<class T> inline void some_namespace::Vector<T>::push_back(const T& val) { if (size_ >= capacity_) { const T val_temp = val; // copy val since it may come from the buffer_ capacity_ += page_size_; T* temp = (T*)(realloc(buffer_ capacity_*sizeof(T))); if (temp != NULL) { buffer_ = temp; } else { free(buffer_); throw some_namespace::UnexpectedEvent(); } buffer_[size_++] = val_temp; } else { buffer_[size_++] = val; } }

10851772,c++,Consider the following situation: I have a library that includes a third party library. This third party library throws very nice useful exceptions derived from std::exception. I'd like to communicate these exceptions to the code that calls my library but I don't want to have to include the 3rd party library in the calling code too. That 3rd party library could potentially change later on. It seems to make sense to create my own classes in my library that inherit from the third party exceptions like so: class myException: public thirdParty {};  Is there an easy way to catch an instance of thirdParty and copy it to myException? Later I may add capability to myException but for now I really just want to make thirdParty available to the calling code without including third party's library there.  I do realize of course that the calling code will know about thirdParty because the headers from the third party library get included in my library header which gets included in the calling code. But I'm trying to establish a contract that says Hey these are the exceptions MY library throws. Later I may swap out the third party lib but I'm still going to throw exceptions that do what its exceptions did.  Is this right? Is there a better way of doing this? Should I just have my calling code be aware of thirdParty exceptions?

22669228,c++,I'm writing the class for storing loading and rendering the static mesh in my DirectX application. I know that Box model can uses 8 vertices but usually it uses 24 or 36 (because one vertex in space is de facto 3 vertices with the same positions and different texture coord/normals). My question is: how about meshes (e.g. character mesh exported from 3ds max or similar application)? I'm working on the exporter plug-in now for my application. Should I:  For each vertex in mesh exports it (as position normal texture coordinates) - will it be enough always/for some cases?  or maybe:  For each face export 3 vertices (pos normal tex coord)  ? I'm not sure if the texture coordinates/normals will be different for the same vertex in 3ds max (same position but different normals/tex coord?). The second aprouch should works fine with D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST but for 5.000 vertices mesh from 3ds max I will get 15.000 real vertices (+/- each 3 will have same pos and different tex coord/normals). Also on the example below the object consists of two parts - top one has #1 smoothing group and bottom one has #2 smoothing group -will my problem looks different for vertex inside smoothing group and between two groups (e.g. connection of top/bottom)? In other words: is the black circled vertex one real vertex with same pos/tex coord/normals or it's 4 vertices with same positions only (4 vertices with same everything makes sense?)? And what about red one? I'm using indexed buffers. 
19621863,ios,My app will send an SMS when the user asks and the composing view pops up.

11244123,c++,I'm trying to do the following: Process A should use OpenMutex to see if Process B is running. Process B should use CreateMutex to let Process A know it's running. Pretty simple actually... What happens is this: 1. Run process A -> It sees that process B is not running. So far so good. 2. Run process B -> It creates the mutex. 3. Run process A again -> It sees that process B is now running. Still good. 4. I close process B (which should close the mutex as well). 5. Run process A -> It still sees that process B is running ! (OpenMutex does NOT fail). What am I doing wrong here ??

30192542,c++,I am trying to implement bfs in c++. In order to do this I have created a variable called closedList which is supposed to keep the states that I have visited already.

36205871,javascript|jquery|html,I have a project that requires the day date and time to be displayed on a website from a specific timezone Central European Time. Ideally I'd like to display it in this format: Tue 4 May 05:52:33 CET I've been able to get the time to display on websites before but this is usually getting the time from the user's end. In this case it should display my time. I know there are quite a few topics about this already but I really haven't been able to get it to work plus including the day and date is an additional difficulty. Any help would be amazing :-)
31188552,c++,According to the MSDN docs EndScene takes no arguments. But I noticed when people hook EndScene their hooked EndScene function takes a IDirect3DDevice9* device argument. For example: IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene hook sometimes get NULL in the paramter IDirect3DDevice9 The person asking this question has an IDirect3DDevice9* device argument for EndScene. Why is this? Here is a second example: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=9HqJ3Wzz
8141724,ios,I've got small CSV file with data. I want all variables in a row to be dependent. Assume I have got values 1 2 3 in the first row and 4 5 6 in second. I have also three objects: objA objB objC. I want to set values the of these objects depending on the values of another. So when the user sets objA's value as 1 I want objB and objC to take values of 2 and 3. But when user sets objC to value 6 I want objA and objB to take values of 4 and 5. What's the best way to archieve this? It's an iOS project.
27209029,c++,I have this code. scores is a field in HiscoreTable of type std::vector<reference_wrapper<Record>> void HiscoreTable::replaceRecord(Record rec) { bool found = false; for (reference_wrapper<Record> r : scores) { if (r.get().name == rec.name) { r = rec; found = true; break; } } if (!found) { scores.push_back(rec); } }  And if I try to do for(reference_wrapper<Record> r : scores) cout << r.get() << endl; a bad_alloc is thrown. Is it because r is not a Record& but a reference_wrapper<Record> and therefore I cannot assign a Record to it? I thought reference_wrapper<Record>::operator= was overloaded to allow such a thing? EDIT: Turns out it was a problem in my destructor where the printing loop was located. At some point I passed a HiscoreTable in to a helper function by value and when it got destructed at the end of the helper function it invalidated the callsite's HiscoreTable. I don't know why printing would break a reference but I guess that's what happened.

37153818,html,I have a HTML table which forms part of a header in a mobile layout. I have a JSFIDDLE here <table class= icon-buttons > <tr> <td class= header-desc > Tasks </td> <td class= header-icon-close > <i class= ion-ios-close ion-fw ></i> </td> <td class= header-icon-edit > <i class= ion-edit ion-fw ></i> </td> <td class= header-icon-delete > <i class= ion-close ion-fw ></i> </td> </tr> </table>  The last three columns have a fixed width of 32px and I want them floated to the right. I want the first column to take up the rest of the space available so it looks like below: | | | Tasks C E D | | |  My last 3 columns CSS is: .header-icon-close .header-icon-edit .header-icon-delete { width: 32px; vertical-align: top; }  I have tried giving the first column a width as a % of the screen size but this does not allow the last three to remain fixed in place. I have also tried floating the last three right but this did not work. Is there a simple CSS way to make the first column take up the rest of available width and no more in case its content is too big the first column / cell should wrap without affecting the last three. | | | Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks C E D | | Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks Tasks | | |

11850804,html,I am writing a report about XML injection attacks in HTML. Thus I am going to have (mangled) HTML content as the content of my HTML. As such I am trying to wrap my HTML content in CDATA blocks but it does seem to be rendering properly. I have the (validated by W3C) document: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd > <html xmlns= http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml > <head> <title>report</title> </head> <body> <div><![CDATA[AuthType=<META HTTP-EQUIV= Set-Cookie Content= USERID=&lt;SCRIPT&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; >]]></div> </body> </html>  From my understanding of the Wikipedia article this means that the content should be marked for the parser to interpret as only character data not markup . So the output should be  AuthType=<META HTTP-EQUIV= Set-Cookie Content= USERID=&lt;SCRIPT&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; >  However in both Chrome 21.0.1180.60 m and Firefox 14.0.1 all that renders is ]]>  What is going on? Shouldn't everything from the <![CDATA[ to the first ]]> appear on screen as if every character had been escaped?

10672607,ios,It's surprising that I can send message on my iPad. The method [MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText] returns YES even on iPad. I don't know why. It was OK (the method would return NO) when I tested about 2 month ago. The iOS version is 5.1 (9B176) and the device is iPad 2 (new Pad has the problem as well). The xcode version is 4.3.1 Has anybody met the same problem?  @jrturton: Yes you're right. When I turn iMessage off [MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText] returns NO. It seems that [MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText] can NOT be used to find whether the device could send SMS. So how?

8992273,ios,I'm running a function to pulse a play icon: - (void)pulsePlayIcon { if ([self isPlaying]) { return; } [[self videoView] playIcon].hidden = NO; [[self videoView] playIcon].alpha = 1.0; [UIView animateWithDuration:[self playIconPulseDuration] delay:[self playIconPulseTimeInterval] options:(UIViewAnimationOptionRepeat | UIViewAnimationOptionAutoreverse) animations:^{ [[self videoView] playIcon].alpha = 0.8; } completion:^(BOOL completed) {}]; }  This works wonderfully in iOS 5.0 but in 4.3 it blocks the UI. The UI doesn't respond. I read that this was the suggested way to do repeating animations in iOS version 4.0 or greater (>= 4.0). The culprit seems to be UIViewAnimationOptionRepeat. Do you see any obvious errors I'm making?
33149633,javascript|jquery|html,I am very new to building websites. I would like to change the background of my pages to a solid colour. Currently the theme I am using is SKT Full Width and the background is opaque. I have a slider in the background and you can see the text that I have added to my page it does not look good. I just want my pages to have a solid background colour but I want to keep the buttons and the text on the slider. If you want to see what my problem is go to my website and click on any page www.mydeparturez.com.
23714863,ios,Wanted to ask if something Objective-C exists to store data on the device quickly and also recover other than sqlite android also have this option:  SharedPreferences prefs = getSharedPreferences( MisPreferencias Context.MODE_PRIVATE); int IdUsuario = prefs.getInt( IdUsuario 0); int IdTipoAuto = prefs.getInt( IdTipoAuto 0);  There is something in Objective-C so fast that you can always read without problem or change at any time even if you close the app Information always persist in app
32249445,ios,Alright here's my code for a simple PickerView and it's working too. @interface ViewController () @property NSArray *moods; @end @implementation ViewController -(NSInteger)numberOfComponentsInPickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView{ return 1; } -(NSInteger)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView numberOfRowsInComponent:(NSInteger)component { return [[self moods] count]; } -(NSString *)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView titleForRow:(NSInteger)row forComponent:(NSInteger)component { return self.moods[row]; } - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; // Do any additional setup after loading the view typically from a nib. self.moods = @[@ I  @ Love  @ Stack  @ Overflow  @ Great! ]; }  My question is about the confusing behaviour about the setter and getter method using properties. To further clarify I don't know why the .(dot) notation of setter method works and the bracket style doesn't. For example under this method  -(NSString *)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView titleForRow:(NSInteger)row forComponent:(NSInteger)component { return self.moods[row]; }  If I type it in as  return [self moods[row]];  That doesn't work. Why? It says missing identifier and on further adding it too like this return [self moods[[row]]];  It doesn't simply work at all. It keeps on asking to add the identifier error. Same goes for this method where the following works fine   self.moods = @[@ I  @ Love  @ Stack  @ Overflow  @ Great! ];  BUT the following code style doesn't work too  [self moods] = @[@ I  @ Love  @ Stack  @ Overflow  @ Great! ];  or even the setValue forKey ones in my case. Alright I agree that I'm fairly new to this and trying to self learn. I tried learning Objective-C and doing my best at it last week and covered all those concepts there. But it's my second day in iOS programming and am finding this minor stuff difficult to grasp. Can you please help and guide a bit in detail? While following a bit of Stanford University classes video on iOS they recommend to always use dot notation for properties. But you can use both right? So I need to understand and build solid foundation. Thanks!
31814380,ios,I've made a highscore and tested it several hours ago it worked fine. My best score was 6 and game saved it. But now I've made a score of 10 then 12 and it still shows me that my highscore is 6. I'm pretty sure I did not touch anything related to that piece of code after I've made it. Here is my highscore: override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) { //highscore var HighScoreDefaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().integerForKey( highscore ) if (score > HighScoreDefaults) { NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().setInteger(score forKey: highscore ) NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().synchronize() } var showHighscore = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().integerForKey( highscore ) highScoreText.text = Highscore : \(showHighscore) highScoreText.fontSize = 34 highScoreText.fontColor = SKColor.grayColor() }  What could go wrong? EDIT: So I put my code edited by @trojanfoe in override func update(currentTime: NSTimeInterval) function and it's working again. I honestly don't know what caused that problem but for those who have same problem that I had – try Update instead of didMoveToView.
29304237,ios,I'm trying to keep the phone's contacts in my app up to date in a persistent way. For that I'm thinking of using Core Data. My plan right now seems highly suboptimal :  Browse the address book and every ABPerson in it Store every field in a CoreData persistent store Store the image in a separate file with an unique name and a reference in another Contact field.  And I do this every time the app comes in foreground in case the user would change one of his contact's name or picture etc. Some of my users have more than 2500 contacts sometimes the operation lasts up to 10 seconds. My question is : Is there a way to keep some kind of reference to my ABPerson in coredata so I can always load my ABPerson properties everywhere instead of Contact properties? (which would then always be up to date). And I'm not even sure it's the right decision : Should I always use the ABRecord that I find with a reference? Should I always use my own copied data that I update regularly (from the ABAddressBook)? If not do you guys think I'm doing this in a decent way or would you suggest something else? EDIT: As asked in the comments: I need to keep the contacts up to date simply to use their firstname lastname and picture properties. If I notice the ABRecord changes I'll update the related custom objects accordingly and that's it. I won't really need anything else afterwards (until they're edited again) Thanks
33091616,ios,I have been trying to develop an app which contains self sizing Table View Cells. I've looked a lot into tutorials and online documentation and came across these two lines of code: self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension (and tried with 44 here also)  The cells would work as following:  The user can write something and choose whether to upload or not an image. The cell would resize according to whether there is in fact an image or not and also according to the text size. My problems are:  I am using a label to hold the text already set to 0 lines. But I cannot put de text aligned to top left. There is a limit to what the user can write; The UIImageView that holds the image is also on a fixed size and the image is set on aspect to fit (I could not come up with a better solution); The code that I've shown above didn't do anything. Should I uncheck something or do something within the cell properties? How should I set my constraints? Of both the label and the UIImageView? 
12153838,ios,Hello I have been trying to customize the UItabBarItem and i have found some piece of code can customize the UItabbaritem but they aren't just working me.

19584116,c#,I am trying to make a plugin for CRM 2011 that will update some values in a contact entity when it has been disabled.  When a contact gets disabled: I want it to change 3 radio buttons to Nei (No in Norwegian). This will disable the access to my self-service portal i have for my customers. You can see a picture of my contact entity with the radio buttons in it here. I want to force all those radio buttons to Nei when contact is disabled. I am a complete beginner with CRM plugin development and a fairly new user of C#. So please keep it as simple as possible. I have been reading through the manuals for weeks and i cant seem to get anywhere. (Well Microsoft is not known for their well written manuals).

19963875,php,Thanks to a lot of different resources both on SO (This one specifically) and the intrawebs in general I've managed to create a pivot table with mySQL.  You can see a working example (limited data) here: SQL Fiddle Now I want to get that data out through PHP and convert it into a json string so I can send it as an ajax response to an HTML page where I'm trying to display a chart (column chart) via google visualization just like this one: https://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/?type=visualization#column_chart My question is: How do I transform the pivot table into the correct format for the chart to understand it? The echo(ed) results from my php file (sph.php) end up with data structured as so: [{ ps_job_serial_num : 888888  105 :null 104 : 4.00  400 :null 101 : 5.00  102 : 3.00  204 : 6.00  103 : 2.00  399 : 1.00  300 : 1.00  205 : 7.00  203 : 2.00  404 :null 405 :null 202 :null 301 :null 106 :null 304 :null 401 :null 201 :null 402 :null 403 :null 303 :null} { ps_job_serial_num : 999999  105 :null 104 : 2.00  400 :null 101 : 1.00  102 : 0.00  204 :null 103 :null 399 : 3.00  300 : 2.00  205 : 3.00  203 :null 404 :null 405 :null 202 :null 301 :null 106 :null 304 :null 401 :null 201 :null 402 :null 403 :null 303 :null} { ps_job_serial_num : 111111  105 : 1.00  104 : 3.00  400 :null 101 : 5.00  102 : 4.00  204 : 10.00  103 : 7.00  399 : 1.00  300 : 2.00  205 :null 203 :null 404 :null 405 :null 202 :null 301 :null 106 :null 304 : 1.00  401 :null 201 :null 402 :null 403 :null 303 :null} { ps_job_serial_num : 222222  105 :null 104 : 1.00  400 :null 101 : 1.00  102 : 1.00  204 : 3.00  103 : 1.00  399 :null 300 :null 205 :null 203 :null 404 : 3.00  405 :null 202 :null 301 :null 106 :null 304 :null 401 :null 201 :null 402 :null 403 :null 303 :null} { ps_job_serial_num : 333333  105 : 2.00  104 : 8.00  400 :null 101 : 8.00  102 : 9.00  204 : 10.00  103 : 8.00  399 : 2.00  300 : 5.00  205 : 8.00  203 : 8.00  404 :null 405 : 7.00  202 : 8.00  301 :null 106 : 1.00  304 :null 401 :null 201 : 6.00  402 :null 403 : 6.00  303 :null} { ps_job_serial_num : 444444  105 : 2.00  104 : 5.00  400 :null 101 : 8.00  102 : 9.00  204 : 10.00  103 : 8.00  399 : 4.00  300 : 3.00  205 : 8.00  203 : 5.50  404 : 2.00  405 : 8.00  202 : 8.00  301 : 2.00  106 : 4.00  304 :null 401 : 10.00  201 : 10.00  402 : 7.00  403 : 7.00  303 : 2.00 } etc  But I really want the data formatted like so: ([ ['ps_job_serial_num' '101' '102' '103' '104' '105' '106'] ['888888' 500 381 381 110 665 157] ['999999' 750 396 381 115 594 173] ['111111' 120 406 381 115 571 167] ['222222' 100 460 381 116 619 185] ['333333' 430 401 381 120 642 195] ['444444' 120 679 381 128 624 198] ]);  How can I make my data look like it needs to look? Here is my full PHP code: <?php $mysqli = new mysqli( localhost  user  password  database ); $query = CALL new_procedure() ; $result = $mysqli->query($query); while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {$results_array[] = $row;} $jsontable = json_encode($results_array); echo $jsontable; ?>  Here is the full HTML page: <head> <title>My realtime chart</title> <script type= text/javascript src= https://www.google.com/jsapi ></script> <script type= text/javascript src= http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js ></script> <script type= text/javascript > // Load the Visualization API and the piechart package. google.load('visualization' '1' {'packages':['corechart']}); // Set a callback to run when the Google Visualization API is loaded. google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart); function drawChart() { var jsonData = $.ajax({ url: sph.php  dataType: json  async: false }).responseText; // Create our data table out of JSON data loaded from server. var data = new google.visualization.DataTable(jsonData); // Instantiate and draw our chart passing in some options. var chart = new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('chart_div')); chart.draw(data {width: 1200 height: 600}); } </script> </head> <body> <div id= chart_div style= width: 1200px; height: 600px; ></div> </body> </html>  The error that is displayed on the HTML page is Table has no columns ... Update #1 After making the changes suggested by @asgallant (below) the data returned from PHP now looks like this: [ [ ps_job_serial_num 105104400101102204103399300205203404405202301106304401201402403303] [ 888888 null4null53621172nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [ 999999 null2null10nullnull323nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [ 111111 13null5410712nullnullnullnullnullnullnull1nullnullnullnullnull] [ 222222 null1null1131nullnullnullnull3nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [33333328null891082588null78null1nullnull6null6null] [444444null3null228311nullnull26nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [555555null2null228321nullnull23nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [666666null2null227312nullnull28nullnullnullnullnullnullnullnullnull] [777777null2null228311nullnull27nullnullnullnull2nullnullnullnull] ]  Which looks correct. However I noticed starting after the 5th line there are no longer quotes around the ps_job_serial_number. I'm wondering if this is what's making it bonk? The error message from the Chrome console is:  Uncaught Error: Not an array (anonymous function) drawChart  Update #2 Changed the query to only return the rows that had quotes around the ps_job_serial_num (to trouble shoot if that was causing the error). it made no difference. The error remains the same:  Uncaught Error: Not an array (anonymous function) drawChart 
29186112,python,I insert items using psycopg2 in the following way: cursor = connection.cursor() for item in items: try: cursor.execute( INSERT INTO items (name description) VALUES (%s %s) RETURNING id  (item[0] item[1]) ) id = cursor.fetchone[0] if id is not None: cursor.execute( INSERT INTO item_tags (item tag) VALUES (%s %s) RETURNING id  (id 'some_tag') ) except psycopg2.Error: connection.rollback() print( PostgreSQL Error: + e.diag.message_primary) continue print(item[0]) connection.commit()  Obviously when an item is already in the database the duplicate key exception is being thrown. Is there a way to ignore the exception? Is the whole transaction is going to be aborted when the exception is thrown? If yes then what is the best option to rewrite the query maybe using batch inserting?
16566395,jquery,Basically I have two text boxes where you can select the 'hour' 00-23 and 'minute' in multiples of 5. What I am trying to achieve is validation so that you can't make a booking within 2 hours of the current date/time. So if the time is now 14:00 and I try to make a booking for 15:30 it will show an alert message. If it's after two hours e.g. 16:00 then it's okay. I just don't any idea how I can achieve this is jQuery since the time value 2 hours greater that 23:00 is 01:00. Any help on this would be much appreciated.

15054720,php|jquery,My name is Dan and i have seen problems with UTF encoding earlier read posts related to this kind of issues here on stackoverflow tried the solutions that you guys have posted but i have to say i am stuck. Ok what i am making is a set of dropdowns that get populated via AJAX (jQuery) and PHP when tha values are changed.  ALL files are saved as UTF-8 The index.php file where all gets displayed have meta tag charset=utf-8  The PHP scripts reads directories and outputs list options based on folder names: $fylke = $_GET['fylke']; foreach (new DirectoryIterator('../pdfs/'.$fylke) as $fileInfo) { if($fileInfo->isDot()) continue; $kommune = $fileInfo->getFilename(); echo <option name='kommune' value=' .$kommune. '> .$kommune. </option> ; }  The Javascript runs functions based on listbox changes: function getKommune() { $.get( get.php  { fylke: $( #fylke ).val() } function(data){ $('#kommune').html(data); $('#kommune').attr('disabled' false); $('#kommune').prepend('<option selected= selected value= --- >---</option>'); }); }  All folders and filenames with no special characters lists just fine. When it comes to a special character (æøå) the listbox do not update with folders or files. I must say i am a beginner at coding help is much appreciated. Here is a link to the non working project: http://www.tbds.no/pdfdl/ Thanks for the great help.

26738746,ios,I have build a custom table cell:  class CustomTableViewCell: UITableViewCell { @IBOutlet weak var streetLabel: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var cityLabel: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var priceLabel: UILabel! func loadItem(#street: String city: String price: String){ self.streetLabel.text = street self.cityLabel.text = city self.priceLabel.text = price } }  Result on iPhone 5:  Result on iPhone 6+  As you can see the left side of the cell is displayed correctly it sticks to the left. However the right side should stick to right but it does not. So here is my question:  How can the width of the cell be set to the width of the tableView so that the cell has the same width as the screen? How can I make the right side actually stick to the right of the table cell?

15970296,javascript,I've been using the Google-provided script to generate and email CSVs from Google Sheets. I customised it so that it doesn't ask for a range or a file name. This way it just automatically emails me periodically with the contents of my range.  The problem is that the CSV contains empty rows at the end that I'd like the script to automatically filter out (which I can't achieve because I just don't have the knowledge). The reason for this in turn is that the range contains empty rows - but there's a good reason for that which is that the rows in the range sometimes expand sometimes contract depending on the underlying data. (The range in fact relates to a pivot table).  As a bonus prize I'd also really like it to skip rows if there is a single zero in either of the two columns in the rows. (I ought to be able to filter this out in the pivot table; I can but then the filters don't work properly if new values appear). This is an example of how my emailed CSVs are looking at the moment:  00 0 0.650 0.7516900 0.782000 0.79500 0.8110800 0.831200 0.8520000 0.874500 0.93500 15000 1.14000 1.241500                This is an example of how I would like to receive that CSV: 0.7516900 0.782000 0.79500 0.8110800 0.831200 0.8520000 0.874500 0.93500 15000 1.14000 1.241500  Any help with this would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks. Here's the script I'm using currently: var settings = { recipients : myemailaddress  emailSubject : CSV file  emailMessage : Your CSV file is attached  fileExtension : .csv  carriageReturn : \r\n }; function onOpen() { var subMenus = []; subMenus.push({name: Email Named Range as CSV  functionName: run }); SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().addMenu( CSV  subMenus); } function run() { /var namedRange = Browser.inputBox( Enter named range to convert to CSV (e.g. sampleDataRange): );/ var namedRange = FORCSVEXPORT ; var fileName = EPCSELLOFFERS.CSV ; if (namedRange.length !== 0 && fileName.length !== 0) { settings.dataRangeName = namedRange; settings.csvFileName = fileName + settings.fileExtension; var csvFile = convertNamedRangeToCsvFile_(settings.dataRangeName settings.csvFileName); emailCSV_(csvFile); } else { Browser.msgBox( Error: Please enter a named range and a CSV file name. ); } } function emailCSV_(csvFile) { MailApp.sendEmail(settings.recipients settings.emailSubject settings.emailMessage {attachments: csvFile}); } function convertNamedRangeToCsvFile_(rngName csvFileName) { var ws = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getRangeByName(rngName); try { var data = ws.getValues(); var csvFile = undefined; if (data.length > 1) { var csv = ; for (var row = 0; row < data.length; row += 1) { for (var col = 0; col < data[row].length; col += 1) { if (data[row][col].toString().indexOf(  ) != -1) { data[row][col] = \ + data[row][col] + \ ; } } // Join each rows columns // Add carriage return to end of each row csv += data[row].join(  ) + settings.carriageReturn; } csvFile = [{fileName: csvFileName content: csv}]; } return csvFile; } catch(err) { Logger.log(err); Browser.msgBox(err); } }

24984012,ios,I was wondering if there is a way to swap out the alertview style notification that happens when a user is inside the app when the notification occurs to the banner notification style (which one would get if another app is active while receiving the push).

8012169,c#,I'm trying to fetch a web page that is a mix of English and Korean. The browser can fetch and display the page just fine but when I try to grab it programmatically I can't get the Korean characters to display properly.  I know that you can specify an Encoding in the StreamReader but I haven't found one that works yet.  This is the code that I'm using to read the response: HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream() Encoding.GetEncoding(response.CharacterSet));  response.CharacterSet returns UTF8. I've also tried all of the basic encoding options - ASCII BigEndian Default Unicode UTF32 UTF7 and manually adding Encoding.UTF8. I've also tried going about it through the CultureInfo: CultureInfo kr = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( ko ); StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream() Encoding.GetEncoding(kr.TextInfo.ANSICodePage));  using both ko and ko-KR . I get varied results from all these different types but none of them are correct. I've also tried the code page directly: StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream() Encoding.GetEncoding(949));  response.ContentEncoding returns an empty string. I'm running out of ideas. Edit: Here is an example of what I'm expecting: 프로젝트: and here is what I'm getting:  //ASCII == ?????? //BigEndian == à¤¼æ±©æ¹«â¨ç‰¥æ˜½âˆ¯æ©³â½¤ç°æ” //Default == Ã­â€â€žÃ«Â¡Å“Ã¬Â ÂÃ­Å Â¸: //Unicode == Ã­â€â€žÃ«Â¡Å“Ã¬Â ÂÃ­Å Â¸ //UTF32 == ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï //UTF7 == Ã­Â”Â„Ã«Â¡ÂœÃ¬Â ÂÃ­ÂŠÂ¸ //UTF8 == í”„ë¡œì íŠ¸

The map contains values which are assigned tiles: eg of a 2D array:  int map[4][4]={ {1 1 1 1} {1 0 0 1} {1 0 0 1} {1 1 1 1} };  I create a sprite in a similar way: int sprite[1][1]={ {2} }; My question is how do you access a specific tile or element in a 2D array ?  I read this post(3rd post down) and wondering whether 2D arrays aren't the best to use. My sprite always stays centred to the window and upon key presses my world moves behind him. I want to collide with certain tiles therefore need some interaction between my sprite 2D array tile and my Map 2D array... Also as it stands I can walk out of the map because I haven't coded it otherwise. How would I go about this ? Ideally I want to stop him leaving the map then I can integrate the collision with that. Below is a screenshot of what things look like(but with a bigger map than shown above): 
18178472,php,On the client side I have a get request called by $.get with jQuery   modify_user.php?uid=SomeUserId   with this XMLHttpRequest I get some userID and load the form. The problem is that in the client side I do not have my user id in case I want to modify my user. So I create another php file called  modify_my_user.php  and basically what I wanted to do was get the id in the server side and simulate a request from server like it was an Ajax request. Something like this require_once 'HTTP/Request2.php'; $r = new HTTP_Request2('Ajax/modify_user.php?uid='.$_SESSION['uid'] HTTP_Request2::METHOD_GET); $r->setHeader(array('X-Requested-With' => 'XMLHttpRequest')); $r->send(); echo json_encode($r->getBody());  this is because in the modify_user I have a reject method if the request isn't a XMLHttpRequest (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) && strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) === 'xmlhttprequest');  the thing is when I try to make the get request from server(in modify_my_user.php) I'm getting this error  HTTP_Request2_LogicException: HTTP_Request2 needs an absolute HTTP(S) request URL 'localhostWeb/Ajax/modify_user.php?uid=17' given in  Is there a way to enable relatives url with this package?
15622432,javascript|jquery,The first part of this script where it wraps some divs and adds a new class works fine.

36043649,php,I have a multi- and variable-level json file that looks like the example at the bottom of this post. What I need to do is search for a particular value let's say Gap junction and return the value for name for all of the higher level parents in this example Junction  Plasma membrane and Cell . I need to do this using php and I think I need a recursive loop to traverse the array that will record the name value for each depth level into an array and then return this name array once the search term is found but I'm struggling a bit at achieving this. Any help would be appreciated. { name : Cell  children : [ { name : Plasma membrane  children : [ { name : Junction  children : [ { name : Adherens junction } { name : Caveola } { name : Gap junction } { name : Lipid raft } { name : Tight junction } ] } { name : Focal adhesion } ] } { name : Vesicle  children : [ { name : Endosome  children : [ { name : Early Endosome } { name : Late Endosome } { name : Recyling Endosome } ] } { name : Microsome } ] } ] }  EDIT Current code as requested. The $found variable is certainly not working how I intended it too. Code is based/modified on this answer: Get Parent and Child depth level from JSON using PHP? $jsonString = file_get_contents( ./information/localization.json ); $jsonArray = json_decode($jsonString); $currOrganelle = Gap junction ; $parents = read_tree_recursively($jsonArray $currOrganelle); function read_tree_recursively($items $searchTerm $result = array() $level = 0 $found = false) { foreach($items as $child) { if(!$found) { $currName = $child->name; if($currName == $searchTerm) { $found = true; return $result; } elseif(!empty($child->children)) { $result[$level] = $currName; $result = read_tree_recursively($child->children $searchTerm $result $level + 1 $found); if($found) return $result; } else { } } else { return $result; } } } 
37350023,javascript|php|html,My goal is to automatically upload an image to a folder when the file is selected. Following the answer on how do I auto-submit an upload form when a file is selected I attempted to use Javascript's onchange event to automatically submit the form: <?php if(isset($_POST['upload'])) { $ImageName = $_FILES['photo']['name']; $fileElementName = 'photo'; $path = '../images/'; $location = $path . $_FILES['photo']['name']; move_uploaded_file($_FILES['photo']['tmp_name'] $location); } ?> <form method= post enctype= multipart/form-data > <input type= file name= photo onchange= document.getElementById('upload').submit(); id= file class= inputfile /> <label for= file >Add Image</label> <input type= submit style= display: none; name= upload id= upload > <input type= text > <input type= submit > </form>  When the file is selected it's not automatically uploaded to a folder. Note: I cannot use onchange= form.submit()  as I have multiple submit buttons in my form!
36723045,c++,The application is running fine and randomly crashes the debugger is displaying this error :   0xc0000005: read access violation QOpenGLFunctions_3_2_Compatibility::glBeginTransformFeedBack  but that doesn't help that much since I don't know where this function is used. Through my tests I think that the problem is coming from the image display. The program retrieves raw data from a remote device connected to a camera and the application is displaying it to show the video in QML app. When I comment for example the source of the image in QML it doesn't crash. In a thread : bool success; DWORD bytesRead; DWORD lastError; const unsigned int imgSize = IMG_HEIGHT * IMG_WIDTH * 1; _rawData = new uchar[imgSize]; while(!_abort) { if(_namedPipe != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) { /* Get raw data from the pipe */ success = ReadFile( _namedPipe _rawData imgSize &bytesRead NULL); if(success) { /* Build an image from the raw data and send it to the PipeVideoStreamPlayer */ QImage clImage(_rawData IMG_WIDTH IMG_HEIGHT QImage::Format_Indexed8); _videostr->updateImage(clImage); }else ...  Image provider : PipeVideoStreamPlayer::PipeVideoStreamPlayer(QQuickView* ptrApp) : QQuickView() QQuickImageProvider(QQmlImageProviderBase::Image) { _ptrApp = ptrApp; }  Update function : void PipeVideoStreamPlayer::updateImage(const QImage& image) { _myImage = image; QObject* objMain = (QObject*) _ptrApp->rootObject(); QQuickItem *obj = objMain->findChild<QQuickItem*>( videoStreamFrame ); QMetaObject::invokeMethod(obj reload ); }  In QML image + reload function called at each frame : Image { objectName: videoStreamFrame cache: false anchors.centerIn: parent source: image://videostream/yellow function reload() { var oldSource = source; source = ; source = oldSource; }  The app can run for 5 minutes before crashing and sometimes it takes only 10 seconds. If I comment the reload function it doesn't crash either. EDIT: Here are the modifications I've done so far : class StreamPainter : public QObject { Q_OBJECT Q_PROPERTY(QImage streamImage READ streamImage WRITE setStreamImage NOTIFY streamImageChanged) public: StreamPainter(QObject *parent = 0); ~StreamPainter(); QImage streamImage(); void setStreamImage(QImage clImage); signals: void streamImageChanged(QImage Image); public slots: private: QImage _streamImage; }; QImage StreamPainter::streamImage() { return _streamImage; } void StreamPainter::setStreamImage(QImage clImage) { _streamImage = clImage; emit streamImageChanged(clImage); }  Set context : view->engine()->rootContext()->setContextProperty( streamImage  streamImage);  In my thread : QImage clImage(_rawData IMG_WIDTH IMG_HEIGHT QImage::Format_Indexed8); _spvideostr->setStreamImage(clImage);  Now I need to display the image in QML but how to do it here without ImageProvider ?

23893489,python,I have 2 strings: string 1 = 'ATCGATCG' string 2 = 'ATCGATCG'  I want to identify which sections of these 2 strings match starting from the first character and building up. For this I am using the code below which slices 1 character at a time: ('A' 'AT' 'ATC' 'ATCG' 'ATCGA' 'ATCGAT' 'ATCGATC' 'ATCGATCG')  Is there a method to get it to count the matches between the slices made of string 1 and 2 to see if they match totally print yes if not print no. I have had trouble identifying how to get it done for each slice. for i in range(0 len(string1)): print string1[0:i] for i in range(0len(string2)): print string2[0:i] 
14893779,javascript|html,I’m transforming dumb quotes into smart quotes in a contenteditable but the problem is that it also replaces them inside HTML elements like: <a href=“something” title=“something”  thus making them invalid. I want to only do it for user’s text. Here’s the catch. I have to keep the original formatting elements so I can’t do something like: clean($('#something_container').text());  This would remove all HTML elements (formatting) when returned. Here’s the code that I have: content = clean($('#post_content').html()); $('#post_content').html(content); // replaces  ' -- <div> with <p> function clean(html) { html = html.replace(/'\b/g \u2018 ) // opening singles .replace(/\b'/g \u2019 ) // closing singles .replace(/ \b/g \u201c ) // opening doubles .replace(/\b /g \u201d ) // closing doubles .replace(/--/g \u2014 ) // em-dashes .replace(/<div>/g <p> ) //<div> to <p> .replace(/<\/div>/g </p> ); //</div> to </p> return html; };  What would be the best (most efficient) way to replace dumb quotes only in user’s text and skip the HTML tags like <img src= />? Thanks!
20954218,javascript,I have this code. Animal = function(age) { Animal.prototype.age = age; }; Animal.prototype.constructor = Animal; Animal.prototype.Walk = function() { console.log( Animal Walking ); }; Pet = function(age name) { Pet.prototype.name = name; }; Pet.prototype.constructor = Pet; Pet.prototype = Object.create(new Animal()); Pet.prototype.DoTricks = function() { console.log(this.name + is doing tricks! ); }; var pet = new Pet(5 Barney ); console.log(pet);  All Animals have an age and can walk. Pet Inherits Animal through its prototype. Pets have names and can do tricks they also have an age and can walk. How can I organise my code to achieve this behaviour? At the moment I can make it so Pets can walk but their age is left undefined since I cannot pass its age through the constructor. Many Thanks!
18757398,php,I am sending an email via CodeIgniter's email->send(). I have come across an anomaly that I cannot figure out.  \r\n is not working in a certain section of the email.

37155792,android,I'm developing an app that uses Open Mobile API. I added this line to my manifest: <uses-library android:name= org.simalliance.openmobileapi android:required= true />  When I remove this line of code it installs ok. But the app is not working properly. But if I add that line I get the error  install_failed_missing_shared_library  Is this because the API is not compatible with my device? I'm using a Famoco device. Any workarounds on this one?
29863161,java,I am creating a view in code using the Couchbase Java API 2.1.2 like this: DefaultView view = DefaultView.create(viewName jsMapFunctionAsString); List<View> views = new ArrayList<>(); views.add(view); DesignDocument doc = DesignDocument.create(name views); bucket.bucketManager().insertDesignDocument(doc);  Calling ViewResult result = bucket.query(ViewQuery.from(name viewName)) directly after inserting the document viewResult.success() always returns true but both iterators rows() and iterator return 0 rows (there are definitely results present. When I execute the view in the web interface it returns correct values). The workaround I found after several hours is to call query twice with enough waiting time in between like ViewResult result = bucket.query(ViewQuery.from(name viewName)); Thread.sleep(10000); result = bucket.query(ViewQuery.from(name viewName));  The second call will then return the correct result. It seems as if Couchbase has to build the index for the query first but returns directly even before the index has been built. Waiting 10 seconds is of course not optimal maybe creating the index will take more time in the future. So my question is how can I make sure that I only wait until the index has been built? Is this a bug in the API?

Can anyone please point out what I could have missed? When I'm adding the same view using Interface Builder all works perfectly fine. So I think I have missed some property or something like that.

10577334,c++,I have to process individual objects of type InternalMessage convert each one into some number of ExternalMessage objects (there is a one-to-many relationship between InternalMessages and ExternalMessages) and put these ExternalMessage objects on a queue to be processed. I want to have two modes of inserting onto this queue - batched where all of the ExternalMessage are inserted onto the queue atomically and normal insertion where the ExternalMessage objects are inserted onto the queue as they are created. Note that there are multiple threads producing messages for this queue. My thought on solving this is having an Inserter object which handles the insertion: class Inserter { public: void ProcessMessage(const ExternalMessage& externalMessage) = 0; }; class SingleInserter { public: SingleInserter(Queue* q) : m_q(q) { } void ProcessMessage(const ExternalMessage& externalMessage) { m_q->Insert(q); } private: Queue* m_q; }; class BatchInserter { public: BatchInserter(Queue* q) : m_q(q) { } void ProcessMessage(const ExternalMessage& externalMessage) { m_cache.Insert(externalMessage); } ~BatchInserter() { m_q->BatchInsert(m_cache); } private: Queue* m_q; List<ExternalMessages> m_cache; };  And then passing the Inserter down the call stack as messages are created. BatchInserter ins;  or SingleInserter ins;  and then HandleMessage(someInternalMessage ins);  and HandleMessage will do: void HandleMessage(const InternalMessage& msg Inserter& ins) { //... do logic eventually create a externalMsg (note - this could be further down //the call stack in a loop etc. Multiple external messages could be created each //call to HandleMessage) ins.ProcessMessage(externalMsg); }  Is this design ideal? It's nice that it allows for different insertion types but is there some way to do this without having to pass an object down the call stack (say via template specialization)? Secondly is there an STL pattern that I should be conforming to in implementing this?

29225962,java,I have written a program that finds the number with the greatest number of divisors from the range 1 to 100000:  /** A program that finds the number with the largest number of divisors in the range of 1 to 100000. This version simply uses threads. */ public class ThreadDivisors{ private static final int SAMPLE_SIZE = 100000; private static final int THREAD_COUNT = 2; private volatile static int maxDividend; private volatile static int maxDivisorCount = 0; public static void main(String[] args){ int start = 1; int end = SAMPLE_SIZE / THREAD_COUNT; DivisorThread[] threads = new DivisorThread[THREAD_COUNT]; for(int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++){ threads[i] = new DivisorThread(start end); System.out.println( Thread created starting at + start + and ending at + end);//debug start += SAMPLE_SIZE / THREAD_COUNT; end += SAMPLE_SIZE / THREAD_COUNT; } for(int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++){ threads[i].start(); } for(int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++){ while(threads[i].isAlive()){ try{ threads[i].join(); } catch(InterruptedException e){ System.out.println(e.getMessage()); e.printStackTrace(); } } } System.out.println( The number with the most divisors is + maxDividend); System.out.println(maxDivisorCount); } static class DivisorThread extends Thread{ static int start; static int end; public DivisorThread(int start int end){ this.start = start; this.end = end; } public void run(){ System.out.println( Thread running... ); divisorCount(start end); } } private static void divisorCount(int start int end){ int divisorCount;//number of divisors for number being divided int maxThreadDividend = start; int maxThreadDivisorCount = 0; for (int dividend = start; dividend <= end; dividend++){//iterate through dividends divisorCount = 0; for (int divisor = start; divisor <= dividend; divisor++){//iterate through divisors if (dividend % divisor == 0){ divisorCount++; }//end if }//end for if (divisorCount > maxThreadDivisorCount){ maxThreadDivisorCount = divisorCount; maxThreadDividend = dividend; System.out.println(maxThreadDividend); System.out.println(maxThreadDivisorCount); } }//end for report(maxThreadDivisorCount maxThreadDividend); } /*This subroutine updates global variables that keep track of which number has the most divisors.*/ private synchronized static void report(int maxThreadDivisorCount int maxThreadDividend){ if(maxThreadDivisorCount > maxDivisorCount){ maxDivisorCount = maxThreadDivisorCount; maxDividend = maxThreadDividend; } } }  It works with one thread (the global variable THREAD_COUNT determines this) but not with more. For instance when I set THREAD_COUNT to 2 I get the following output: Thread created starting at 1 and ending at 50000 Thread created starting at 50001 and ending at 100000 Thread running... 50001 1 Thread running... 50001 1 The number with the most divisors is 50001 1 The subroutine divisorCount() seems to just stop with the starting point of whatever thread has the largest starting point...it does not go further. What might be causing this problem?

25063145,java,I'm trying to use the jackcess library to create a database and import data into it. The problem I have found is that if I create a table named type  which is a reserved word for jackcess then I can not import data into this table using the ImportBuilder. A new table is generated with the prefix x (the new table will be named xtype ). I also have tried to create the table with another name import data and the rename to reserved name. But I wasn't able to find any method to rename tables. The table has to be named type . What should I do?
33405460,ios,Firstly I found it is easy for me to format other type Such as Int for Example: let i = 12345 let s = String(format: %-10d  12345) //then s = 12345  The right-hand-side a few space is exactly what I need! But when I try to implement it to a String (Am I right if I use %@ ?) let str = 12345 let s = String(format: %-10@  str) //then s = 12345 rather than 12345  How could I do it to achieve the same result?

CDbCommand failed to execute the SQL statement: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'post_id' doesn't have a default value. The SQL statement executed was: INSERT INTO `tbl_comment` (`status` `content` `author` `email` `url` `create_time`) VALUES (:yp0 :yp1 :yp2 :yp3 :yp4 :yp5)  This same error was on status first but I set the default value for it in the database.

9385828,java,public void TurnTowardsPoint(double DestinationX double DestinationY) { int distX = (int) (DestinationX - x); int distY = (int) (DestinationY - y); double angleRadians = Math.atan2(distY distX); int angleDegrees = (int)Math.toDegrees(angleRadians); //angleDegrees = Math.abs(angleDegrees); Log.w( Angle  Integer.toString(angleDegrees)); Log.w( Degrees  Integer.toString((int) this._degrees)); if((this._degrees) - 360 != angleDegrees) { if(this._degrees >= 0) { RotateItem(true); } else { RotateItem(false); } } }  RotateItem(true is clockwise false is anti it can never go minus otherwise it resets to 0 although this is changeable). What I'm trying to achieve is to get the shortest way to rotate & also finish when it's pointing at the Angle point of origin. I've been on this for a few hours now my problem is I never got taught Trigonometry at school so I'm struggling with the concepts & understanding what to use when. (I've been reading up on it). How would I do this? I can't find anything online so I had to eventually give up and asked you guys after staring at a piece of paper for 2 hours and getting no where. Notes: Facing right the ship is 360/0D. If the ship is directly under the point it is -90 above it is +90. If the ship is to the right directly it is 180D. The problem lies with the 2 if statements. The First if statement needs to stop the rotation when it's pointing at the angle the second one is suppose to decide which way is shortest. Those 2 statements are wrong. The problem lies with this part:  if((this._degrees) - 360 != angleDegrees) { if(this._degrees >= 0) { RotateItem(true); } else { RotateItem(false); } } 
11702141,javascript|jquery,I have a web applciation based on apache php js/jquery. One module of the application is initialized when the document is loaded. That sequence calls an init() funcion that performs a number of tasks amongst others it fetches two html dialogs via ajax and inserts them into the existing page. A reference to those dialogs is saved as variables so that I don't have to specify jquery selectors throughout my scripts but can simply use those variables instead. This work fine except that there are very few cases (now and then...) when the variables are 'undefined' when trying to bind a handler to an element inside the fetched dialogs. Which is odd because apart from that bind the dialogs are usable throughout the application. This suggests that the ajax calls succeed but aparently there is some kind of race condition so that now and then the variables are only set after the bind attempt.  In my understanding this should not happen since the bind is done in the .done() part of a when() and should only be executed after the ajax retrieval of the dialogs has finished inside the when().  Aparently I am missing something fundamental here. Anyone got a hint for me ?  The following cites code excerpts from the working implementation. They may appear syntactically invalid as some parts but that is just due to the removal of code parts not relevant here. The unshortened code works fine.  The variables:  Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List:{}; Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click:{};  The initializing sequence:  $(window).load(function(){ //... var dfd = new $.Deferred(); $.when( // load layout of dialog to show the list of tracked clicks Shorty.Tracking.init() ).done(function(){ // bind actions to basic buttons Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List.find('#close').on('click'function(){ // ... }); // ... }); // ... })  The shortened init function:  Shorty.Tracking.init:function(){ // ... var dfd=new $.Deferred(); // two dialogs are used by this plugin var dialogs={ 'list': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List 'click': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click }; // load dialogs from server $.each(['list''click']function(idialog){ if (...){ // ... dfd.resolve(); }else{ // load dialog layout via ajax and create a freshly populated dialog $.ajax({ type: 'GET' url: OC.filePath('shorty-tracking''ajax''layout.php') data: { dialog: dialog} cache: false dataType: 'json' }).pipe( function(response){return Shorty.Ajax.eval(response)} function(response){return Shorty.Ajax.fail(response)} ).done(function(response){ // create a fresh dialog // insert it alongside the existing dialogs in the top controls bar $('#controls').append(response.layout); switch (dialog){ case 'list': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List=$('#controls #shorty-tracking-list-dialog').first(); break; case 'click': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click=$('#controls #shorty-tracking-click-dialog').first(); } // switch dfd.resolve(); }).fail(dfd.reject) } // else }); // each return dfd.promise(); }   With the answer of Bergi I managed to apparently remove the original problem. Until now I could not detect any more failed bind attempts. However I could not follow that suggestion completely: in his answer he suggested to remove the switch statement in the initialization method in favor of a direct assignment. This certainly is much more elegant but that won't work. I have the impression there is some missunderstanding on my side about how javascript handles references and/or functions stored in variables.  Maybe you Bergi or someone else can shed some explaining light on this:  This is the modifed initialization method from above:   init:function(){ if (Shorty.Debug) Shorty.Debug.log( initializing tracking list ); // check if dialogs already exist if ( $.isEmptyObject(Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List) && $.isEmptyObject(Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click) ){ // two dialogs are used by this plugin var dialogs={ 'list': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List 'click': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click }; // load dialogs from server var dfds=$.map(dialogsfunction(objdialog){ // load dialog layout via ajax and append it to the collection of dialogs in the controls return $.ajax({ type: 'GET' url: OC.filePath('shorty-tracking''ajax''layout.php') data: { dialog: dialog} cache: false dataType: 'json' }).pipe( function(response){return Shorty.Ajax.eval(response)} function(response){return Shorty.Ajax.fail(response)} ).done(function(response){ // create a fresh dialog and insert it alongside the existing dialogs in the top controls bar $('#controls').append(response.layout); // obj=$('#controls #shorty-tracking-'+dialog+'-dialog').first(); switch(dialog){ case 'list': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List=$('#controls #shorty-tracking-list-dialog').first(); break; case 'click': Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.Click=$('#controls #shorty-tracking-click-dialog').first(); break; } // switch }) }) // map return $.when.apply(null dfds); }else{ // dialogs already loaded just clean them for usage Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List.find('#list-of-clicks tbody tr').remove(); new Deferred().resolve(); } // else }  In the middle you see the assignment statement commented out and currently replaced by the switch statement below. I tried several variations like obj.element and so on but failed. Outside the function the variables Shorty.Tracking.Dialog.List and Shorty.Tracking.-Dialog.Click remain empty.  I am an absolute newbie to web stuff ans js/jquery. but I am certainly curious to learn more about this way of handling references. 
28881578,java,Is there any Hibernate configuration equivalent of `ehcache.xml?
6251083,java,I would like to replace named parameters in a string with values like when using Python's % operator. Spring supports something very similar to the functionality I need with NamedParameterUtils but for some reason it's tightly coupled to Jdbc and replacing those named-parameters with question marks.  So if I want to do  :a is :b % { a : Java  b : Beautiful } must I resort to using some heavy artillery like Velocity? or am I missing something simple? Update: used Dmitry's code to write my own simple version: public static String formatSqlWithNamedParams(String sqlTemplate Map<String Object> params){ StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); Pattern var = Pattern.compile( \\$\\{\\s*([\\w\\[\\]\\(\\)\\.]+)\\s*\\} ); Matcher match = var.matcher(sqlTemplate); int offset = 0; while (match.find()) { writer.write(sqlTemplate.substring(offset match.start())); String key = match.group(1); Object val = params.get(key); writer.write(val.toString()); offset = match.end(); } writer.write(sqlTemplate.substring(offset)); return writer.toString(); } 
2785270,c#,This is another exam related question. How can I use the AssemblyName class to represent an existing assembly that already exists on disk? I am talking about from the perspective of using the AppDomain's instance method .Load() that takes an AssemblyName object as a parameter. I know what MSDN has to say about what the .Load() method was designed for; but that aside I still want to know how to use it.

8296287,jquery,I've recently included jQuery to my website to animate two boxes depending on how far down the page the user scrolls. They both appear from the top of the page so are not visible when the page initially loads up (Negative margin-top number). The code is below but you can also see a JSFiddle of it here. JavaScript $(document).ready(function() { var away = false; $(document).scroll(function() { if ($(document).scrollTop() > 150) { if (!away) { away = true; $('#red-box').stop().animate({ 'margin-top': '0px' } 500); } } else { away = false; $('#red-box').stop().animate({ 'margin-top': '-30px' } 150); } }); }); $(document).ready(function() { var away = false; $(document).scroll(function() { if ($(document).scrollTop() > 250) { if (!away) { away = true; $('#blue-box').stop().animate({ 'margin-top': '30px' } 500); } } else { away = false; $('#blue-box').stop().animate({ 'margin-top': '-200px' } 150); } }); });  HTML <div id= red-box ></div> <div id= blue-box ></div>  CSS body { height:2000px; } #red-box { position:fixed; width:100%; height:30px; margin-top:-30px; background-color:red; z-index:2; } #blue-box { position:fixed; width:150px; height:200px; margin-left:60px; margin-top:-200px; background-color:blue; z-index:1; }  This seems to work great on all latest versions of all the browsers but it doesn't work at all on IE8 and below (no real surprise there). The boxes do not animate when the user scrolls and so never appear on the screen. Could anyone help me to get this to work on IE8? and possibly even IE7?
26239411,ios,I want to add a little button in the bottom right corner of a UITableView. When we are in the top half of the tableview the button programmatically scrolls you to the bottom and when you are in the bottom half it takes you to the top. And the button's icon changes from goto top to goto bottom or vice versa depending on the situation. In my code below the button works fine- you press it when you are at the top you hit the bottom and the button graphic changes to the goto top icon. However dragging up and down like you would traditionally in a table doesn't make the button change it's icon properly. You even need to pull past the border (top or bottom) of the table to make it flip to the correct state. When a button is pressed if we are past halfway (as defined by a function pastHalfway) we go either to the top or bottom of the table. Something is wrong with it but I've tussled a bit and basically made things not work well in various ways. I think the problem is I am not determining the midpoint content offset of the table correctly. func pastHalfway() -> Bool { // TODO: This doesn't work let offset:CGPoint = self.tableView.contentOffset let height:CGFloat = self.tableView.frame.height println( pastHalfway offset.y=\(offset.y) height=\(height) ) return offset.y > (height/3.0) // 3.0 is 3/4 down the table } func gotoButtonPressed(sender: UIButton!) { if let realPost = post { if realPost.numberComments > 0 { if self.pastHalfway() { let indexPath:NSIndexPath = NSIndexPath(forRow: 0 inSection: 0) self.tableView.scrollToRowAtIndexPath(indexPath atScrollPosition: UITableViewScrollPosition.Top animated: true) } else { let indexPath:NSIndexPath = NSIndexPath(forRow: realPost.numberComments - 1 inSection: 1) self.tableView.scrollToRowAtIndexPath(indexPath atScrollPosition: UITableViewScrollPosition.Bottom animated: true) } } } } func maybeShowGotoButtons() { let yOffset:CGFloat = self.tableView.contentOffset.y if (self.post!.numberComments < minRowsToShowGotoButtons) { // Hide and disable buttons self.gotoButton.hidden = true self.gotoButton.enabled = false } else { // Show buttons depending on content offset if self.pastHalfway() { self.gotoButton.setImage(UIImage(named: gotoTopIcon ) forState: .Normal) } else { self.gotoButton.setImage(UIImage(named: gotoBottomIcon ) forState: .Normal) } // And enable self.gotoButton.hidden = false self.gotoButton.enabled = true } }  UIScrollView Delegates override func scrollViewWillBeginDragging(scrollView: UIScrollView) { UIView.animateWithDuration(0.1 animations: { self.gotoButton.alpha = 0.5 }) } override func scrollViewWillEndDragging(scrollView: UIScrollView withVelocity velocity: CGPoint targetContentOffset: UnsafeMutablePointer<CGPoint>) { UIView.animateWithDuration(0.2 animations: { self.gotoButton.alpha = 1.0 self.maybeShowGotoButtons() }) } override func scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation(scrollView: UIScrollView) { // This is used for the programmatic scroll top/bottom when clicking buttons self.maybeShowGotoButtons() } 
7890688,c#,So i have a table that is built dynamically that adds rows for each machine in the database. Each row contains 4 columns and With 2 of the columns added to the table they contain a RadComboBox that gives the user the ability to select certain values that come from the database. the method that builds each row for the table  private void AddNewRow1(Machine Machine) { //start a new row TableCell site = new TableCell(); TableCell name = new TableCell(); TableCell type = new TableCell(); TableCell model = new TableCell(); TableRow tr = new TableRow(); Literal breakline = new Literal(); breakline.Text = <br /> ; Literal breakline1 = new Literal(); breakline1.Text = <br /> ; //site name column site.RowSpan = 2; site.Controls.Add(AddSiteField(Machine)); tr.Controls.Add(site); //machine name name.RowSpan = 2; name.Controls.Add(AddMachineField(Machine)); tr.Controls.Add(name); //machine type name type.RowSpan = 2; type.Controls.Add(AddMachineTypeField(Machine)); type.Controls.Add(breakline); type.Controls.Add(AddTypeComboBox()); tr.Controls.Add(type); //machine model name model.RowSpan = 2; model.Controls.Add(AddMachineModelField(Machine)); model.Controls.Add(breakline1); model.Controls.Add(AddModelComboBox()); tr.Controls.Add(model); AssignPlaceHolder.Controls.Add(tr); }  The method in the model and type controls AddModelComboBox() or AddTypeComboBox() is below:  private RadComboBox AddModelComboBox() { RadComboBox MachineModelCombo = new RadComboBox(); machineModel = inputsService.GetMachineModelList(SiteID); foreach (MachineModel MachineModel in machineModel) { if (MachineModel.Name != NULL ) { MachineModelCombo.Items.Add(new RadComboBoxItem(MachineModel.Name MachineModel.ID)); } } MachineModelCombo.EnableLoadOnDemand = true; MachineModelCombo.EmptyMessage = Select a Machine Model ; return MachineModelCombo; }  The table works fine and is built correctly. Where i am having my problem in the code below has to do with obtaining the value of these dynamically build comboboxes:  protected void Update_Click(object sender EventArgs e) { string MachineTypeID; string MachineModelID; machine = inputsService.GetMachineSiteDetails(SiteID); foreach (Machine Machine in machine) { try { RadComboBox machineTypeComboBox = new RadComboBox(); RadComboBox machineModelComboBox = new RadComboBox(); MachineTypeID = machineTypeComboBox.SelectedValue; MachineModelID = machineModelComboBox.SelectedValue; inputsService.UpdateMachineModels(Machine.ID MachineTypeID); inputsService.UpdateMachineTypes(Machine.ID MachineModelID); } catch (Exception ex) { { logger.ErrorFormat( Update_Click exception occurred when attempting to update the database {0}  ex); } } }  My question is how can i get the selected value from a dynamically built radcombobox? Note:   inputsService.UpdateMachineModels(Machine.ID MachineTypeID); inputsService.UpdateMachineTypes(Machine.ID MachineModelID);  these two lines are webservice calls to a DB api to make updates to the database depending on the item selected in the web page. The same goes for any call that starts with inputsService.* any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks
29239617,java,I am trying to parallel a matrix multiplication. I have achieved parallelization by calculating each cell of Matrix C in a separate thread. (I hope i have done this correctly). My question here is if using thread pool is the best way for creating threads. (Sorry i am unfamiliar with this and someone suggested to do in this way) Also will i see a great difference in the time it takes to calculate with a sequential version of the program compared to this? import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class ParallelMatrix { public final static int N = 2000; //Random size of matrix public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); //Create and multiply matrix of random size N. double [][] a = new double [N][N]; double [][] b = new double [N][N]; double [][] c = new double [N][N]; int ijk; for(i = 0; i < N ; i++) { for(j = 0; j < N ; j++){ a[i][j] = i + j; b[i][j] = i * j; } ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1); for(i = 0; i < N; i++) { for(j = 0; j < N; j++) { pool.submit(new Multi(Nijabc)); } } pool.shutdown(); pool.awaitTermination(1 TimeUnit.DAYS); long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println( Calculation completed in + (endTime - startTime) + milliseconds ); } static class Multi implements Runnable { final int N; final double [][] a; final double [][] b; final double [][] c; final int i; final int j; public Multi(int N int i int j double[][] a double[][] b double[][] c){ this.N=N; this.i=i; this.j=j; this.a=a; this.b=b; this.c=c; } @Override public void run() { for(int k = 0; k < N; k++) c[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]; } } } 
16772716,c#,I have a C# WCF service that hosts 120 GB of memory in a Dictionary<Filebyte[]> for very fast access of file contents which really worked well with me. Upon access the file contents were wrapped within a MemoryStream and read This service needs to be restarted everyday to load some static data from the database that could change on daily basis. The restart took so much time because of the huge data that need to be loaded again into memory So I decided to host this memory in a different process on the same machine and access it through sockets. The Data process will be always up and running. TcpListener/Client and NetworkStream were used in a similar fashion to the following memoryStream.Read(position.PositionData 0 position.SizeOfData); position.NetworkStream.Write(position.PositionData 0 position.SizeOfData);  Problem is: this was 10 times slower than hosting the memory in the same process. Slowdown is expected but a factor of 10 is too much. I thought of MemoryMappedFiles but those are more useful for random access to a specific view of the file. My file access is sequential from the beginning all the way to the end.  Is there a different technology or library that could be used in my case? or is this just so expected?
29538052,python,I am logging data via:  with open('filename.txt''a') as fid: fid.write(line_of_data)  Granted the amount of time the file is open is short for each write but I will write data every second making it extremely repetitive. Since this is being used on a remote system there is always the chance that power will be interrupted causing the computer to shutdown. If power is cut in the middle of a fid.write() will the whole file become corrupt or since it was opened to append will only the last line be lost? 
37232834,javascript,I want to learn how can I return boolean value from consecutive functions in Javascript? I want to run the next function if previous function returns true. For example there is a main function and there is 3 sub functions. It will be like this: run the first function if it returns true run the second one and if the second returns true run the third function if the third function returns true then the main function also returns true. Can someone show me a simple example for that. I wrote an example but it always returns false :) I want to learn the logical best way for that. Thanks all from now :)  My example:  var uname; $( #username ).keyup(function() { uname = checkUsername(); console.log(checkUsername()); }); // Username keyup function allowedChars() { var username = document.getElementById( username ).value; var chars = /^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\_]*$/; if(chars.test(username) == true) { $( #notName ).html( ).show(); return true; } else { $( #notName ).html( Username can just contain A-Z 0-9 dot and underscore! ).show(); return false; } } // allowedChars function unameLen() { var username = document.getElementById( username ).value; if ((username.length > 3) && (username.length < 20)) { $( #notName ).html( ).show(); return true; } else { $( #notName ).html( Username must be between 3 and 20 characters! ).show(); return false; } } function unameAvl() { var username = document.getElementById( username ).value; $.post( check.php  { username: username } function(result){ if (result == true) { $( #notName ).html( ).show(); return true; } else { $( #notName ).html( Username is already exists! ).show(); return false; } }); } function checkUsername() { allowedChars(); if (allowedChars()) { unameLen(); } if (unameLen()) { unameAvl(); } if (unameAvl()) { return true } else { return false; } } 
13243533,javascript|jquery,I am trying to auto populate a date range of visible elements. The code I have works fine as long as there is only one empty end date that is filled but I am having difficulty understanding why the clone() method is running twice. Fiddle is here. Basically they are jobs and roles. A job can have many roles and I guess roles within a parent job could have overlapping start and end times but is not necessary for this aspect. The Jobs can and do overlap start and end times. The code works by looking for the start and end times described within the HTML of the ROLES and if there is no end time designated then to populate the roles end time as CURRENT . Then to populate the JOB times it gathers all of the start times in the array start (var start = []) and all the end times in the array end (var end = []). It then sorts start and end and takes the first start index(date) for the beginning of the JOB and the last index(date) of end for the JOB's end date. Somehow the issue is in the line $(this).find('>h1').after($('.workexperience time.end[datetime=' + end[end.length-1] + ']').clone());  as the arrays seem to be correct.  Can you help point me in the right direction of the error in my code? per nnnnnn: the query $('.workexperience time.end[datetime=' + end[end.length-1] + ']') PRIOR TO THE CLONE is: [ ​Current ​​  ​Current ​​ ] [ ​Sep 2012​​ ] [ ​Current ​​  ​Current ​​  ​Current ​​  ​Current ​​ ] [ ​Mar 2006​​ ] [ ​Jun 2002​​ ] The query end[end.length-1] of the variable end results in : 2012-11 2012-09 2012-11 2006-03 2002-06

The values that I receive are ever equal to zero and are not the same ones I went through parameter. Thanks in advance! EDIT: My route config: <?php return array( 'controllers' => array( 'invokables' => array( 'Mediador\Controller\Mediador' => 'Mediador\Controller\MediadorController' ) ) // The following section is new and should be added to your file 'router' => array( 'routes' => array( 'mediador' => array( 'type' => 'segment' 'options' => array( 'route' => '/mediador[/:action][/:id]' 'constraints' => array( 'action' => '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*' 'id' => '[0-9]+' ) 'defaults' => array( 'controller' => 'Mediador\Controller\Mediador' 'action' => 'index' ) ) ) ) ) 'view_manager' => array( 'template_path_stack' => array( 'Mediador' => __DIR__ .

I'm initalizing tinymce when user clicks the content area so dom must be ready then.

6982387,php|jquery,I am having problem with Yii and jQuery mobile. The problem is that jQuery mobile only use js files from rel= external  link that are inside div with data-role= page . Yii generates active form js at the end of div or in the header I tried to put  <script src='lala/js.js' type = text/javascipt ></script>  and I could bind the js and css with : js.js: $('div').live('pagebeforeshow' function(event ui){ $( head ).append( <link> ); css = $( head ).children( :last ); css.attr({ rel: stylesheet  type: text/css  href: /site/css/mobile/mobile.css }); $.getScript( /site/js/fancyForm_qe.js  function(){ //some other stuff ); }); $('.successMessage').hide(); });  the problem is that I want to use Yii functions to add css and js. Any solutions?
24302085,c#,I have two side by side Emgu imagebox and I want their size to be relative to that of the users screen size (33% of the screens width). I tried to set it using something like this in the main form: rectangle screen = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds; int screenHeight = (screen.Height/2); int screenWidth = screenHeight;  and then setting the size to these in the designer form but that just led it to not load the imagebox at all. If anyone knows how to do it with a pictureBox that may work too.  Here is a picture of my form to help get an idea of what I am trying to achieve. I would like to have these proportions on a screen of any size. Like the % feature in css. http://oi59.tinypic.com/dwdf12.jpg (I have linked it due to lack of reputation)
6018965,c#,The title is not entirely accurate I have a Container control with a property of type PanelControlCollection which is basically a collection of PanelControl: public class PanelControl : System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel { public string Title { get; set; } } public class PanelControlCollection : Collection<PanelControl> {}  My custom User Control: public partial class FormSlideShow : BaseUserControl { [PersistenceMode(PersistenceMode.InnerProperty)] public PanelControlCollection Panels Title { get; set; } protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer) { foreach(var panel in Panels) { ContentPlaceHolder.Controls.Add( new LiteralControl( <fieldset class='step' Title=' + panel.Title + '> )); ContentPlaceHolder.Controls.Add(panel); ContentPlaceHolder.Controls.Add( new LiteralControl( </fieldset> )); } base.Render(writer); } }  I wanted to be able to make a custom control and add pages in markup (code in Default.aspx): <ctrl:FormSlide runat= server ID= frmSlide > <Panels> <ctrl:PanelControl runat= server ID= page1 ><asp:Button runat= server ID= btnTest OnClick= btnTest_Onclick /></ctrl:PanelControl> <ctrl:PanelControl runat= server ID= PanelControl1 >Page 2</ctrl:PanelControl> </Panels> </ctrl:FormSlide>  My question is if I want to host the control in a normal aspx page how can I connect my Button control (btnTest) to the OnClick event in the code behind of default.aspx? If I put a normal Panel control with a button I can attach events to the onclick but not with my custom control. btw here is my code behind on default.aspx the code which I want to run but can't: protected void btnTest_Onclick(object sender EventArgs e) { Response.Redirect( http://www.google.com ); }  Thanks.
13708521,php,Form last 2 days i am trying to fix a issue of uploading a file in Box.net using php. I have gone through Box.net API Documentation and copied the sample code they have given the code that they have given- uploads file perfectly But it redirects to that page where server response is printed(XML response). I do not want to show user such screen instead i would like to read those data and based on that response display message of mine. I have edited my code as per the guidance given by @GBD now i am facing another issue. The file I select does not upload  Instead it uploads some .tmp file. And when i hard code the file path in $_POST['new_file1'] it successfully uploads correct file. the file path i get is some thing like this C:\wamp\tmp\php1A.tmp not actual file path when i echo $_FILES['new_file1']['tmp_name']. Can any one tell me how can i get the file path from $_FILES ? So that i can pass it to $post Following is my code: <?php $upload_url = 'https://upload.box.net/api/1.0/upload/i9g1fmnnddfdr4739sxvbpXXXXXXXX/480416060'; $tmpfile = $_FILES['new_file1']['tmp_name']; $filename = basename($_FILES['new_file1']['name']); $_POST['new_file1'] = '@'.$tmpfile; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_URL $upload_url); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER false); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_POST true); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_HEADER true); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFERtrue); curl_setopt($ch CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS $_POST); $response = curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); echo $response; ?> <form action= enctype= multipart/form-data accept-charset= utf-8 method= POST > <input type= file name= new_file1 /> <input type= text name= share value= 1 /> <input type= submit name= upload_files value= Upload File /> </form>  Please help me out.  Thanks in advance.

37669517,python,In tkinter I would like to create the following: When the button foo is pressed the function foo begins running immediately. A new window will pop up with a a cancel button that lets the user terminate the process midway through (as my actual process can take up to 30 minutes). If foo runs to completion the window closes itself and notifies the user that the process completed.  Here is code that demonstrates my toy problem:  from tkinter import ttk messagebox Toplevel Tk import time import multiprocessing def foo(): for i in range(100): print(i) time.sleep(0.1) class TerminatedProcess(Exception): def __init__(self str = Process was terminated ): self.error_str = str class ProcessWindow(Toplevel): def __init__(self parent process): Toplevel.__init__(self parent) self.parent = parent self. process = process terminate_button = ttk.Button(self text= Cancel  command=self.cancel) terminate_button.grid(row=0 column=0) self.grab_set() # so you can't push submit multiple times def cancel(self): self.process.terminate() self.destroy() raise TerminatedProcess def launch(self): self.process.start() self.process.join() self.destroy() class MainApplication(ttk.Frame): def __init__(self parent *args **kwargs): ttk.Frame.__init__(self parent *args **kwargs) self.parent = parent self.button = ttk.Button(self text = foo  command = self.callback) self.button.grid(row = 0 column = 0) def callback(self): try: proc = multiprocessing.Process(target=foo) process_window = ProcessWindow(self proc) process_window.launch() except TerminatedProcess as e: # raised if foo is cancelled in other window messagebox.showinfo(title= Cancelled  message=e.error_str) else: messagebox.showinfo(message= sucessful run  title= Finished ) def main(): root = Tk() my_app = MainApplication(root padding=(4)) my_app.grid(column=0 row=0) root.mainloop() if __name__ == '__main__': main()  With this code when the button foo is pressed process_window is indeed made because the the function foo runs and I get a run successful dialogue box but the window never pops up! This is a problem because the user needs to have the option of terminating foo. Interestingly enough If I delete process_window.launch() I will still get the run successful message (as expected) but the process_window shows up. I have tried putting the launch command inside the initialization but that made the window not show up either. I also tried starting the process outside the window declaration as follows: proc.start() process_window = ProcessWindow(self proc) proc.join()  The window still failed to show up but the process ran.  My question is how do I need to arrange these pieces to generate the ProcessWindow AND automatically start the process when the ProcessWindow opens? UPDATE (workaround): I am aware that I could create a start button inside the ProcessWindow that would run the function (and then disable the button after it had been pressed once) but I would still like to know how to implement what was described in the original question.
34706466,java,The generated output JAR of a maven-plugin project (using the maven-plugin-plugin) is broken by the obfuscation performed by the Proguard tool. Attempting to use the obfuscated JAR as a Maven plugin generates exceptions such as a MojoExecutionException which terminate the build with an error. What are the proper Proguard configuration options to allow the generation of a working maven-plugin JAR containing an automatically generated plugin descriptor?

4613622,c#,I have a contact page on my site that seems to have been latched on to by a spammer. The error itself is:  System.IO.EndOfStreamException: Unable to read beyond the end of the stream. at System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadByte() at System.Web.UI.ObjectStateFormatter.DeserializeIndexedString(SerializerBinaryReader reader Byte token) at System.Web.UI.ObjectStateFormatter.DeserializeValue(SerializerBinaryReader reader)  Google turns up little. I assume they are submitting an invalid viewstate but the exception has no line number so im stumped. Edit: My question is where can I catch this exception or check the validity of the viewstate.\
29773918,python,I was wondering whether there is a way to refer data from many different arrays to one array but without copying it. Example: import numpy as np a = np.array([23456]) b = np.array([5678]) c = np.ndarray([len(a)+len(b)]) offset = 0 c[offset:offset+len(a)] = a offset += len(a) c[offset:offset+len(b)] = b  However in the example above c is a new array so that if you modify some element of a or b it is not modified in c at all. I would like that each index of c (i.e. c[0] c[1] etc.) refer to each element of both a and b but like a pointer without making a deepcopy of the data.
