I don't set any time based expiration on the objects as I'm using the cache simply as a high performance drive and as long as there is space I want it used. To my surprise the cache refused to evict any objects to the point that I would get SystemOutOfMemory exceptions. I fired up perfmon wired up my application to .Net CLR Memory\\#Bytes In All Heaps .Net Memory Cache 4.0 and Process\\Private Bytes -- indeed the memory consumption was out of control and no cache trims were being registered. Did some googling and stackoverflowing downloaded and attached the CLRProfiler and wham: evictions everywhere! The memory stayed within reasonable bounds based upon the memory size limit I had set. Ran it in debug mode again no evictions. CLRProfiler again evictions. I finally noticed that the profiler forced the application to run without concurrent garbage collection (also see useful SO Concurrent Garbage Collection Question). I turned it off in my app.config and sure enough evictions! This seems like at best an outrageous lack of documentation to not say: this only works with non-concurrent garbage collection -- though I image since its ported from ASP.NET they may not have had to worry about concurrent garbage collection. So has anyone else seen this? I'd love to get some other experiences out there and maybe some more educated insights.  Update 1 I've reproduced the issue within a single method: it seems that the cache must be written to in parallel for the cache evictions not to fire (in concurrent garbage collection mode). If there is some interest I'll upload the test code to a public repo. I'm definitely getting toward the deep end of the the CLR\/GC\/MemoryCache pool and I think I forgot my floaties...  Update 2 I published test code on CodePlex to reproduce the issue. Also possibly of interest the original production code runs in Azure as a Worker Role. Interesting changing the GC concurrency setting in the role's app.config has no effect. Possibly Azure overrides GC settings much like ASP.NET? Further running the test code under WPF vs a Console application will produce slightly different eviction results."}

When working with JNI it is necessary to ask the JNIEnv object for jclass and jmethodID for each class and method that will be used in the C\/C++ code. Just to be clear I want to call Java contructors or methods from C\/C++. Since the communication from Java to C\/C++ (and viceversa) is costly I initially thought that one way to minimize this was to reuse the jclass and jmethodID. Therefore I saved this instances in global variables as follows: jclass someClass = NULL; jmethodID someMethod = NULL; JNIEXPORT jobject JNICALL Java_example_method1(JNIEnv *env jobject jobj) { \/\/ initialize someClass and someMethod if they are NULL \/\/ use someClass and someMethod to call java (for example thru NewObject) } JNIEXPORT jobject JNICALL Java_example_method2(JNIEnv *env jobject jobj) { \/\/ initialize someClass and someMethod if they are NULL \/\/ use someClass and someMethod to call java again }  A more specific (and useful) example which I use to throw exceptions from anywhere in my JNI functions: jclass jniExceptionClass = NULL; void throwJavaException(JNIEnv *env const char* msg) { if (!jniExceptionClass) { jniExceptionClass = env->FindClass( example\/JNIRuntimeException ); } if (jniExceptionClass) env->ThrowNew(jniExceptionClass msg); } }  The problem is that I continued to use this pattern and got a segmentation fault that was only solved by not-reusing this variables (this was the solution to the previous post). The questions are:  Why is it illegal to reuse the jclass and jmethodID thru different JNI functions? I thought that this values were always the same. Just for curiosity: what is the impact\/overhead of initializing all necessary jclass and jmethodID for each JNI function? "}

Some answers here just tell me to use NewGuid() because that's what it's made for . I'm looking for a more in depth reason as to why the cooked up method may be more likely to generate collisions given the same degrees of freedom as a Guid.  Edit 2: We were also using the cooked up method to generate post ID's which unlike session tokens need to look pretty for display in the url of our website (like http:\/\/mywebsite.com\/14983336) so guids are not an option here however collisions are still to be avoided."}

Using System.Linq there's of course an extension method called Distinct. In the simple case it can be used with no parameters like: var distinctValues = myStringList.Distinct();  Well and good but if I have an enumerable of objects for which I need to specify equality the only available overload is: var distinctValues = myCustomerList.Distinct(someEqualityComparer);  The equality comparer argument must be an instance of IEqualityComparer<T>. I can do this of course but it's somewhat verbose and well cludgy. What I would have expected is an overload that would take a lambda say a Func<T T bool>: var distinctValues = myCustomerList.Distinct((c1 c2) => c1.CustomerId == c2.CustomerId);  Anyone know if some such extension exists or some equivalent workaround? Or am I missing something? Alternatively is there a way of specifying an IEqualityComparer inline (embarass me)? Update I found a reply by Anders Hejlsberg to a post in an MSDN forum on this subject. He says:  The problem you're going to run into is that when two objects compare equal they must have the same GetHashCode return value (or else the hash table used internally by Distinct will not function correctly). We use IEqualityComparer because it packages compatible implementations of Equals and GetHashCode into a single interface.  I suppose that makes sense.."}

How can I tie this into one database?  2) Also if I have a user who has access to both areas  what would be a good way to 'direct' that user to change between both departments? 3) Finally regarding the different directories is there a more efficient way to do this? Each directory is essentially the same exact code just with minor changes. This is something that I've never done so some help on creating this the 'right' way would be great. Especially while it's small if I eventually expand this out to other departments. Thanks!"}

(here) and here and I'm wondering if this is the best way to do this or if there is a more universally-accepted best practice for this.

However I can't put the outer res.send() in an else block because that will kick out of my loop before it should. So is adding a return statement like so: ... for (var i = 0; i < thingList.length; i++) { if (thingList[i].id === req.params.somethingId) { thingList.splice(i 1); return res.send(thingList[i]); } } res.send( Nothing with that ID found ); ...  or alternatively: ... res.send(thingList[i]); return; ...  the best options I have?

Saving opening closing usually doesn't work.  Sometimes if I resort or change selection criteria it will update partially but even then it's hard to get it to display my changes properly. I've taken to simply manually editing the XML file rather than using their provided GUI for it but I do sometimes wonder if it's not some simple thing I could do to fix this.  I guess it might be hard for you guys to know what is specifically causing the issue on my end but maybe someone has encountered a similar problem before and knows some things that might have caused it? Well if not I can continue editing the XML file manually as I've been doing not as if it's all that much trouble but I thought I might as well ask."}

I have two livewallpapers one is called the Past one is called the Future what I want to do is put both into one livewallpaper (sort of a two for one deal) but let the user decide which one they want to load. How I had it set up for one (let's say the Past) I had the onDraw method running in a class called the Past (it did not impliment anything) just past the onDraw and put the whole livewallpaper togeather. In the livewallpaper engine I had this.  public class ThePastActivity extends WallpaperService { @Override public Engine onCreateEngine() { return new ThePastActivityEngine(); } class ThePastActivityEngine extends Engine { private Past _past; public ThePastActivityEngine() { this._past = new Past(); this._past.initialize(getBaseContext() getSurfaceHolder()); } @Override public void onVisibilityChanged(boolean visible) { if(visible){ this._past.render(); } } @Override public void onSurfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder int format int width int height) { super.onSurfaceChanged(holder format width height); } @Override public void onSurfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) { super.onSurfaceCreated(holder); this._past.start(); } @Override public void onSurfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder) { super.onSurfaceDestroyed(holder); this._past.stop(); } @Override public void onOffsetsChanged(float xOffset float yOffsetfloat xStep float yStep int xPixels int yPixels) { this._past.drawXOff = Math.round((this._blimp.theBackgroundImage.getWidth() - initFrameParamsWidth()) * -xOffset); this._past.drawYOff = Math.round((this._blimp.theBackgroundImage.getHeight() - initFrameParams()) * -yOffset); this._past.render(); } }  Now I have two instead of one. The new one is called Future so now I have it like so:  public class ThePastActivity extends WallpaperService { public static final String SHARED_PREFS_NAME = livewallpapersettings ; public static final String PREFERENCE_BACK = livewallpaper_back ; @Override public Engine onCreateEngine() { return new ThePastActivityEngine(); } class ThePastActivityEngine extends Engine implements SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener{ private SharedPreferences prefs; private String whichEra; private Past _past; private Future _future; \/\/make a new name ChooseEra and let it become either Past or Future private ChooseEra _chooseEra; public ThePastActivityEngine() { this._chooseEra = new ChooseEra(); this._past.initialize(getBaseContext() getSurfaceHolder()); prefs = TheSteampunkCityActivity.this.getSharedPreferences(SHARED_PREFS_NAME 0); prefs.registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener(this); onSharedPreferenceChanged(prefs null); } public void onSharedPreferenceChanged(SharedPreferences prefs String key) { whichEra=(prefs.getString(PREFERENCE_BACK past )); \/\/ from here I want to get either the past or future \/\/ make the ChooseEra to be either Past or Future \/\/ and use that for this livewallpaper engine instead } @Override public void onVisibilityChanged(boolean visible) { if(visible){ this._chooseEra.render(); } } @Override public void onSurfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder int format int width int height) { super.onSurfaceChanged(holder format width height); } @Override public void onSurfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) { super.onSurfaceCreated(holder); this._past.start(); } @Override public void onSurfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder) { super.onSurfaceDestroyed(holder); this._chooseEra.stop(); } @Override public void onOffsetsChanged(float xOffset float yOffsetfloat xStep float yStep int xPixels int yPixels) { this._chooseEra.drawXOff = Math.round((this._chooseEra.theBackgroundImage.getWidth() - initFrameParamsWidth()) * -xOffset); this._chooseEra.drawYOff = Math.round((this._chooseEra.theBackgroundImage.getHeight() - initFrameParams()) * -yOffset); this._chooseEra.render(); } }  So chooseEra has to become either Future or Past so it reads one of the two classes only and passes the arguments along through the engine.

I have a facade class called DataAccess which wraps multiple repositories and gets passed around my application. Every controller has a dependency upon DataAccess so I've hooked it up to unity to pass out as required. Data Access looks roughly like this in truncated\/abstracted form: public class DataAccess : IDataAccess { private MyDataContext DataContext = new MyDataContext(); public Repository1 Repo1 = new Repository1(); public Repository2 Repo2 = new Repository2(); public DataAccess() { Repo1.DataContext = DataContext; Repo2.DataContext = DataContext; } }  Then each controller has a dependency upon IDataAccess like so: public class MyControllerBase { [Dependency] IDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; } }  Unity hands these out according to what appears to be normal configuration registering types in Global.asax hooking controllers up to a factory resolving with unity. Furthermore I've registered it with a PerThreadLifetimeManager() which I am unsure whether is correct. For the most part this works great - however the problem can be reproduced by:  Go to Edit action and post an edit (redirects to Index) Go back into the Edit action and attempt to post another edit OR go into Delete action and attempt to post a Delete on the same item  This throws the Row Not Found or Changed error. Each action (Edit and Delete) calls SubmitChanges() on the DataContext. So I'm not quite sure what's going on here. If anyone has any ideas they would be extremely well received. Cheers Tim."}

I have resolved all the issues of duplicate references class name colisions and some compilation errors faced at on Build Solution stage. Due to the earlier website pattern class names are in the following pattern: for e.g. if UserMaster is in admin\/Operations\/Masters folder so the class name will be like: admin_Operations_Masters_UserMaster. Now Web Application is Building Successfully and when I try to run the application it shows  Could Not Load Type 'ClassName'  so I found out that the issue of because Namespaces are absent due to earlier Website Pattern. Found out in the MSDN:  By default pages and classes that are built by using the Visual Studio Web site project model do not automatically include a code namespace. However pages controls and classes that are built by using the Visual Studio Web application project model automatically include a code namespace. When converting the Web site project to a Web application project you will have to add the namespaces to the code.  I have DEFAULT NAMESPACE in the project properties. So I tried to add the namespaces to whole of the project via ReSharper -> Refactor -> Adjust Namespaces but its for .cs files only and not for .aspx.cs etc AND so its not working. I thought I need to make a utility to add the namespaces automatically in pages as per their folder path structure but its a time consuming process. So need a workaround to add the namespaces automatically in pages as per their folder path structure. Secondly What I did for testing is I have wrapped the default namespace in login page of the project where I faced 'could not load type issue' added in Inherits attribute also. Then did a Clean Solution then Rebuild Solution. But still getting the same issue. I don't why DLL is not getting updated with the login page's class. The strange thing is when I change the Codebehind to CodeFile (attribute of Page Directive) then the page is working very fine. Its due to source file is present at the time of running the project BUT i want to use Codebehind attribute as it will tell the compiler to look for the class in DLL not in Source file.  Finally Summary is : I have two major issues:  Could not load type 'className' How to add the namespaces automatically in pages as per their folder path structure.   I have already searched here and came around different topics but nothing works for me. one have suggested to use Surround With feature of VS but I need to go one by one on each file which is NOT possible right now. So Tried:   Set path of DLL to bin instead of bin\\debug  Checked the Build Configuration and its of x86. also the DLL is present in bin Checked all project properties and all are fine. Cleaned and rebuild solution hundreds of times. Cleaned Temporary ASP.NET files also. Set Build Action to Compile for .cs class files Cannot set Build action to Compile for aspx pages as they are static html and they should be set to  Content  which is default Build Action. Resharper solution for adding namespaces but not working   Please help.... Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks."}

This is triggered when the user resizes the browser window and it (among other things) properly recalculates the width of the scrollable area.

Thanks for the replies re getSubscriptions.Count(). That gives me one solution - to get the ajax polling function to search the viewmodel for subscribers each time it polls. What I'd really like to do though is to allow the polling function to be notified each time the number of subscriptions changes to\/from zero so it can start and stop polling - this will be more processor-efficient than searching the viewmodel each time. What would be perfect is if there could be a computed observable as a child of the main observable called say subscriptionsCount() and the poller (or anyone else) could then subscribe to that. Another way I've considered is to wrap my 'value' in a computed observable a la http:\/\/www.knockmeout.net\/2011\/06\/lazy-loading-observable-in-knockoutjs.html..

We are using our own database access layer (in this example simplified as the 'Db' class). Sometimes we would like to retrieve a list of a select part of the available properties in a business object (e.g. only the id and last name of a customer). In Entity framework I could use something like the following: var keyValues = context<Customer>.Select(c => new { Id = c.ID LastName = c.LastName City = c.City })  But as I said before we are not using Entity FrameWork but our own data access objects. For this example I created a database object 'Db' and a static class that can be used to fetch data from the database (now only supports one type of data object): class Db { public static IEnumerable<T> GetData<T>() { if (typeof(T) == typeof(DataClass)) { IEnumerable<DataClass> items = new DataClass[] { new DataClass { IntValue1 = 101 IntValue2 = 102 StringValue1 = 1_1  StringValue2 = 1_2 } new DataClass { IntValue1 = 201 IntValue2 = 202 StringValue1 = 2_1  StringValue2 = 2_2 } new DataClass { IntValue1 = 301 IntValue2 = 302 StringValue1 = 3_1  StringValue2 = 3_2 } new DataClass { IntValue1 = 401 IntValue2 = 402 StringValue1 = 4_1  StringValue2 = 4_2 } new DataClass { IntValue1 = 501 IntValue2 = 502 StringValue1 = 5_1  StringValue2 = 5_2 } }; return items as IEnumerable<T>; } \/\/ else return Enumerable.Empty<T>(); } }  And to fetch the data from the database: static class DataList <TSource> { public static IEnumerable<TSource> GetList() { return Db.GetData<TSource>(); } }  And the data object being used looks like this: class DataClass { public int IntValue1 { get; set; } public int IntValue2 { get; set; } public string StringValue1 { get; set; } public string StringValue2 { get; set; } }  I then would like to be able to do something like this: var items = DataList<DataClass>.GetList(x => new { Value1 = x.IntValue1 });  I started by taking a look at the method signature of the 'Select' Linq extension method that provides the same functionality and created the following method in the 'DataList' class. public static IEnumerable<TResult> GetList<TSource TResult>(Func<TSource TResult> selector) { IEnumerable<TSource> data = Db.GetData<TSource>(); return data.Select(selector); }  Let's forget that in this example I would first fetch the complete dataset from the database and only later simplify the dataset by only selecting one of the properties into an anonymous object. The thing is however that The solution as described above doesn't work. I am getting a compiler error on the line below: var items = DataList<DataClass>.GetList(x => new { Value1 = x.IntValue1 });  The error is:  *Error 2 The type arguments for method 'AnonymousTypeTest.DataList.GetList(System.Func)' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly. O:\\Ontwikkel\\TryOuts\\AnonymousTypeTest\\AnonymousTypeTest\\Form1.cs 21 25 AnonymousTypeTest *  In my opinion both TSource and TResult are known.

The one problem is that HttpListener manages and blocks manual setting of the WWW-Authenticate header. Which is fine if you limit yourself to the built-in Basic NTLM etc authentication or don't need authentication but is a problem if you want to accept any other kind of tokens. I am using JWT tokens with a REST style interface using Basic[1] auth for the initial authentication. In another part of the app I am doing something similar but using custom tokens and\/or Basic auth as a fallback in another part of the API.  The question: How can I get HttpListener to send the WWW-Authenticate: Basic challenge header while also allowing non-Basic Authorization tokens through?  I have tried setting both Basic and Anonymous in the listener thusly: _listener.AuthenticationSchemes = AuthenticationSchemes.Basic | AuthenticationSchemes.Anonymous;  This results in no WWW-Authenticate header being returned under any circumstances. I believe this is supposed to allow either Basic or unauthenticated connections and should also set the WWW-Authenticate challenge when I set the status code to 401 (HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized). But it does not (on either mono or .NET). If I only set AuthenticationSchemes.Basic HttpListener refuses all connections without a Basic style token which is not remotely useful. Obvious but lame workaround: Currently I am simply violating the HTTP specification and returning 401 without a WWW-Authenticate header. This works but reduces compatibility with third party tools. I have considered using a completely different HttpListener implementation although most seem to be either in the prototype stage or part of a large library of their own. I have considered writing my own HttpListener but at that point porting the entire application to Java begins to look attractive. I would like to find recommendations that are less work than a complete platform port or writing my own library. Ideas? [1] - Basic auth is needed here for backward compatibility with low level scripts and some other systems. Please assume that I understand the security implications and am using SSL etc."}

First of all I want to say that I've been reading a lot and I tried to document myself but after weeks I am still a bit lost on this topic. Project configuration  My architecture follows this structure: JSF Beans --> Facade layer --> Service Layer --> DAO Layer My hibernate handles all DAOS and is fully integrated with Spring. The whole Datasource and Hibernate configuration is done in Spring configuration files so spring manages everything. I use Spring Security to handle the project security.  Everything seems to be well integrated but I still can't find a solid solution to manage Hibernate Sessions. My first approach was to use OSIV using JSF PhaseListeners but then I integrated Spring and started using @Transactional annotations on my Service layer. Here are my questions:  I think everytime @Transactional method is invoked an Hibernate session is opened and closed right? Or am I wrong? With @Transactional I am sure I am going to run in trouble because Hibernate's Lazy instantiation on the Render response phase and I don't want to do EAGER fetch. So ... Is it safe to use OSIV? Or is it really vulnerable to DOS attacks? Is there a better way to handle Lazy fetching problem than OSIV pattern? I am sure I am missing better patterns can you throw a little bit of light to the topic?  I didn't post any code because all my questions are basically conceptual on architecture but if you need any of my code to understand me (I know I am a mess explaining myself) you just have to ask me and I'll post it as soon as I can. Thank you all!"}

But eventually i haven't got result yet. Where is this string 'X-Requested-With=XMLHttpRequest&_=1409287722659' appears from? Obviously this is browser's behaviour. "}

I've been using their certificate and connecting to https:\/\/myapp.onmodulus.net using an AndroidHttpClient instance which has worked fine but running into some problems trying to use ssl on my own custom domain name. I've purchased and installed a certificate from thawte for my domain and when I connect using a browser everything goes fine. I see the little lock icon and when I inspect the certificate that's being used its my thawte certificate not the *.onmodulus.net certificate. Before installing my own certificate it showed the this connection is not trusted warning and I could see the *.onmodulus.net certificate was being used. However when I try to connect in my android app I have less success. When opening a url and managing the httpsURLConnection like so: URL myURL = new URL( https:\/\/www.myapp.com ); HttpsURLConnection myConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) myURL.openConnection(); try { System.out.println( Response Code : + myConnection.getResponseCode()); Certificate[] certs = myConnection.getServerCertificates(); for(Certificate cert : certs){ System.out.println( Cert Details: + cert.toString()); }  everyting goes fine the site responds correctly and it shows that my thawte certificate and only my thawte certificate is being used. The *.onmodulus.net certificate doesn't show up at all. However when I try to connect using DefaultHttpClient like this: DefaultHttpClient myClient = new DefaultHttpClient(); HttpGet getRequest = new HttpGet( https:\/\/www.myapp.com ); HttpResponse rawResponse = myClient.execute(getRequest);  I get a: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <www.myapp.com> != <*.onmodulus.net> OR <*.onmodulus.net> OR <onmodulus.net>  I'm not exactly sure how to inspect the certificates more closely but now it seems to be using the wildcard *.onmodulus.net certificate instead of my thawte certificate and I don't really understand why. I've already written my app using HttpClient instances so really would prefer to be able to connect that way instead of using something like the first solution if possible."}

I have even tried some of the code samples but they don't work for me. I have spent several days trying to figure this out but so far I've failed. I don't think this a variable scope problem but I could be wrong. Since the actual script is too long to post I will show only my logic and I hope this is enough. Main script logic: <?php require_once General functions require_once Validator class require_once DB table setup function ForValidationRule() { } if($_POST) { validation rules if(validations pass) { variables set foreach(loop thru selected tables to create) { foreach(loop thru table array to build query) { $sql .= $data . PHP_EOL; } } } } ?>  This is the table array used during my tests: $tbl_names = array ( `id_no` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT  `type_id` CHAR(1) NOT NULL  `abbrev` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL  `description` VARCHAR(75) NULL DEFAULT NULL  PRIMARY KEY (`id_no` ASC)  UNIQUE INDEX `type_id-abbrev` (`type_id` ASC `abbrev` ASC))  ENGINE = {$engine}  CHARACTER SET {$charset} COLLATE {$dbcoll}  AUTO_INCREMENT = 2  COMMENT = '{$company} {$tbl_name['names']['full']}'; );  The 3 variables I'm having trouble with are: $engine $dbcoll and $charset. When I echo the variables before building the query they are correct. When I echo the variable after building the query they are correct. But this is the result of building the query: CREATE TABLE `tester`.`name_pre-suf`( `id_no` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT `type_id` CHAR(1) NOT NULL `abbrev` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL `description` VARCHAR(75) NULL DEFAULT NULL PRIMARY KEY (`id_no` ASC) UNIQUE INDEX `type_id-abbrev` (`type_id` ASC `abbrev` ASC)) ENGINE = CHARACTER SET COLLATE AUTO_INCREMENT = 2 COMMENT = 'CEF Inc. Name Prefixes\/Suffixes File';  As can be seen all 3 variables are blank in the query. Using 1 variable $engine I have tried several methods but none work.  ENGINE = {${$engine}} ENGINE = . $engine 'ENGINE = ' . $engine  Can anyone see what I've done wrong? The code does work correctly if I hard code the values instead of using variables. EDIT 1: I made a mistake in my original logic sample. The variables are set before entering any foreach loop. I have corrected the logic sample. This is how I set those variables: $dbhost = $_POST['dbhost']; $dbuser = $_POST['dbuser']; $dbpass = $_POST['dbpass']; $dbname = $_POST['dbname']; $dbcoll = str_ToLower($_POST['dbcoll']); $dbcoll_ary = explode( _  $dbcoll); $charset = trim($dbcoll_ary['0']); $engine = 'innodb'; if($charset == 'utf8mb4') { $engine = 'innodb ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC'; }  And this is where I echo before building the query and after. echo($engine . PHP_EOL); echo($dbcoll . PHP_EOL); echo($charset . PHP_EOL); $sql = CREATE TABLE `$dbname`.`{$tbl_name[$key]['db']}`( . PHP_EOL; foreach(${'tbl_' . $key} as $data) { $sql .= $data . PHP_EOL; } \/\/ Closing brace for foreach(${'tbl_' . $key} as $data) echo($engine . PHP_EOL); echo($dbcoll . PHP_EOL); echo($charset . PHP_EOL); echo($sql . PHP_EOL); exit();  The echoed values are correct they are the values the user selected.

For various contractual\/political reasons we're stuck with JSF 1.2.  However. we are using Spring beans throughout our application in order to get AoP logging.  It is somewhat annoying that we can't use JSF 2.0. In particular view scope would be ideal for our app. It will be a high usage site and keeping all the page beans in session scope is wasteful and I'm sure will cause raised eyebrows from our non-functional testing team later on. It occurred to me that I could emulate View Scope by using Spring's custom scope and a custom JSF component that simply maintains a map of active beans set by the Spring scope and attaching this component on our pages. Together with a custom variable resolver that can find beans in this map we should be able to emulate view scope (Our journey is only four pages but each page has a few postbacks to the same page) How does this approach sound? I want to be sure I'm not somehow shooting myself in the foot before I present this to my project colleagues and dash off and start ripping apart the bean code we've already written. "}

The main (and only) difference between the two is that the Direct Checkout link should skip the cart and redirect to checkout when clicked. I used this code for the functionality and as you can see there is a comment that applies here.  All I need to do is to put a parameter \/checkout\/ to the url . It's driving me crazy. So this is the check in an Observer file if (Mage::app()->getRequest()->getParam('checkout')) {  Seems easy enough but I've been breaking my head and scouring the web for an answer how to addParam in such a way that this check returns true. This is the form(action) on which I want this functionality: <form action= <?php echo $this->helper('checkout\/cart')->getAddUrl($_product) ?>checkout\/ method= post id= product_addtocart_form <?php if($_product->getOptions()): ?> enctype= multipart\/form-data <?php endif; ?>  As you can see I added the \/checkout\/ manually to the url which works when you look at the url the browser points to i.e: <form action= example.com\/checkout\/cart\/add\/uenc\/aHR0cDovL2JrZm9vdHdlYXIuaHlwZXJub2RlLmlvL21hbi9yb2NvLmh0bWw\/product\/5651\/form_key\/Zs9uAOj8oTuQFAbj\/checkout\/ method= post id= product_addtocart_form <input= type= hidden name= sid value= checkout >  But it doesn't work it looks like the check function doesn't see it. I think this has a most simple answer but as I said it's killing me for days now. Any ideas? Maybe change the if-statement to something checking if checkout is in the called url? Update 2016: In this same situation I found myself needing to change this solution for tracking-reasons. What I did now (relates to this question) was to have the default Add To Cart button in place and added another (default) button with a jQuery onClick function that set the url to the correct add-to-cart-URL with the selected choices of the variable product. Using AJAX I check if the URL is called correctly and if so redirect to checkout. A much simpeler solution."}

When I try using these the event handlers never get called. Looking on the web I replaced these events with collapse and expand. With these the event handler would be called when the collapsible was clicked but the collapsible widget would not collapse or expand either before or after the handler ran. It's not just a visual issue because the state of the collapsible as read with .collapsible('option' 'collapsed') did not change either. Inside the handler I tried various combinations of adding or removing the ui-collapsible-collapsed class or setting the collapsible option before a .trigger('create') and even triggering the collapsiblecollapse and collapsibleexpand inside the handler (when it was bound to collapse and expand of course). Removing the .off() lines made no difference (I can't imagine why it would). Nothing I've tried so far will cause the collapsible to collapse or expand when clicked on when the handler actually runs while bound to collapse or expand. It doesn't matter what code is actually in the handler or whether I have a data-collapsed attribute in the <div> tag to begin with or not. So it seems there's something I'm missing and I would appreciate any help in seeing the error in my ways."}

Please point out my mistake! I have also tried: from PyQt4 import Qt  It gives the same error UPDATE: based on Messa's comment I made few changes: import Qt import sys class ASMovableLabel(Qt.QLabel): def mouseReleaseEvent(self event): button = event.button() if button == 1: print ('LEFT CLICK') def mousePressEvent(self event): button = event.button() if button == 1: print ('LEFT CLICK') elif button == 3: print ('RIGHT CLICK') self.setLayout() #this won't set to nil def mouseMoveEvent(self event): self.frameRect().setTopLeft(Qt.QPoint(event.globalX() event.globalY()))  So it seems that in Python the dot syntax are function calls and need to include that trailing () .

One person can have many measurements but each measurement has only one person. So it is a 1:M relationship between person and measurement. I already have a list which shows all persons. The database entities from the persons table are converted to person objects by my self-written object relational mapping class then the person names are shown in the list. Now I have to expand the list to show not only the person names but also the number of measurements for each person. One list entry should look like this: Person XY 2 Measurements  One approach would be to make a separate COUNT query for each person just before the list is shown. However this would be a really inefficient and bad solution. Another approach would be to add a ref_count column to the persons table which has to contain the number of related measurements. If feels like a relational database has a bad structure for problems like this. How should I implement the list?"}

Onchange the following function is called. function open_contact(id) { $( #contact_info ).load( \/includes\/support\/stg\/editcontact?id= +id); if(id != NewContact ) { $(contact_update() #contact_update ); }else{ $(contact_add() #contact_add ); } }  Let's assume the user has decided to edit their contact information (all 3 update pages use roughly the same function but with the variables changed to reflect the page it took information from). function contact_update() { $('input.text-input').css({backgroundColor: #ffffe0 }); $('input#ldate').live('focus' function(){ $(this).datepick({dateFormat: 'dd\/mm\/yy'}); }); $( input.text-input ).live('focus' function(){ $(this).css({backgroundColor: #FFFFFF }); }); $( input.text-input ).live('blur' function(){ $(this).css({backgroundColor: #ffffe0 }); }); $('.error''#contact_info').hide(); $( .buttonupd ).live('click' function() { \/\/ validate and process form \/\/ first hide any error messages $('.error').hide(); var forename = $( input#forename ).val(); if (forename == ) { $( label#forename_error ).show(); $( input#forename ).focus(); $('input#forename').css({border: solid #aa0000 }); }else{ $('input#forename').css({border: }); } var surname = $( input#surname ).val(); if (surname == ) { $( label#surname_error ).show(); $( input#surname ).focus(); $('input#surname').css({border: solid #aa0000 }); }else{ $('input#surname').css({border: }); } var phone = $( input#phone ).val(); if (phone == ) { $( label#phone_error ).show(); $( input#phone ).focus(); $('input#phone').css({border: solid #aa0000 }); }else{ $('input#phone').css({border: }); } var email = $( input#email ).val(); if (email == ) { $( label#email_error ).show(); $( input#email ).focus(); $('input#email').css({border: solid #aa0000 }); }else{ $('input#email').css({border: }); } if((forename == ) || (surname == ) || (phone == ) || (email == )){ return false; } var contactid = $( input#contactid ).val(); var jobtitle = $( input#jobtitle ).val(); var site = $( select#site option:selected ).val(); var mobile = $( input#mob ).val(); var ldate = $( input#ldate ).val(); var loginallowed = $( input[name='loginallowed']:checked ).val(); var editaddress = $( input[name='editaddress']:checked ).val(); var editcontacts = $( input[name='editcontacts']:checked ).val(); var editcompany = $( input[name='editcompany']:checked ).val(); var lognewissue = $( input[name='lognewissue']:checked ).val(); var viewallissues = $( input[name='viewallissues']:checked ).val(); var viewchangelog = $( input[name='viewchangelog']:checked ).val(); var viewdownloads = $( input[name='viewdownloads']:checked ).val(); var newissuenotify = $( input[name='newissuenotify']:checked ).val(); var closeissuenotify = $( input[name='closeissuenotify']:checked ).val(); var changelognotify = $( input[name='changelognotify']:checked ).val(); var viewsitehardware = $( input[name='viewsitehardware']:checked ).val(); var viewcompanyhardware = $( input[name='viewcompanyhardware']:checked ).val(); var dataString = 'contactid=' + contactid + '&forename=' + forename + '&surname=' + surname + '&jobtitle=' + jobtitle + '&site=' + site + '&email=' + email + '&phone=' + phone + '&mob=' + mobile + '&ldate=' + ldate + '&loginallowed=' + loginallowed + '&editaddress=' + editaddress + '&editcontacts=' + editcontacts + '&editcompany=' + editcompany + '&lognewissue=' + lognewissue + '&viewallissues=' + viewallissues + '&viewsitehardware=' + viewsitehardware + '&viewcompanyhardware=' + viewcompanyhardware + '&viewchangelog=' + viewchangelog + '&viewdownloads=' + viewdownloads + '&newissuenotify=' + newissuenotify + '&closeissuenotify=' + closeissuenotify + '&changelognotify=' + changelognotify; \/\/alert (dataString);return false; $.ajax({ type: POST  url: \/includes\/support\/stg\/contactupd  data: dataString success: function() { $('#contact_update').html( <div id='contact_upd_msg'><\/div> ); $('#contact_upd_msg').html( <h2>Contact Successfully Updated<\/h2> ) .append( <p>Thank you.<\/p> ) .hide() .fadeIn(1500 function() { $('#contactselect').html( ) $( #contactselect ).load( \/includes\/support\/stg\/contactsel ); }); } }); return false; }); }  The first time the function is executed it is called only once and appears to be fine. However if the above function is called a second time to perhaps update another contact two requests are sent updating the information twice and refreshing the select box with a list of contacts in twice.

I reverted back to 1.4.2 and these functions are only ever executed once regardless of how many times they're called without a page refresh. The .live() method was introduced to me here on SO when i first wrote the system and worked well at the time since the .buttonupd does not exist in the DOM when the settings.php page is loaded is this my problem?"}

Due to circumstances beyond my control the two processes need to be kept separate -- that is I can't convert them into two threads within the same process.

I bind my actions to the view   var bindAction = function (view) { $(view).on('click' '.editCompanyType' function () { var company_type = ko.dataFor(this); editCompanyType(company_type); }); };  So when I click my entity I will run my edit method  var editCompanyType = function (company_type) { var diag = new genericModal(company_type.company_type_text 'f\u00f6retagstyp'); diag.viewUrl = 'views\/config\/genericModal'; app.showDialog(diag).then(function (diagResult) { if (diagResult === 'update') { \/\/update Save(); } else if (diagResult === 'delete') { \/\/delete deleteCompanyType(company_type); } else { logger.log( Du gjorde inga \u00e4ndringar!  null panel  true); } }); };  This will in turn load my modal which is made generic and takes the datafor text aswell as a string to represent the current type context.  var genericModal = function (genericType genericnametype) { this.generic_type = ko.observable(genericType); this.placeholder_text = 'Skriv din ' + genericnametype; this.modal_title = ko.observable('L\u00e4gg till ' + genericnametype); \/\/Uppercase machine this.modal_toastr_text = genericnametype; this.modal_header = genericnametype[0].toUpperCase() + genericnametype.slice(1); this.update_button_text = ko.observable('L\u00e4gg till ' + genericnametype); this.delete_button_text = ko.observable('Ta bort ' + genericnametype); this.deleteAllowed = ko.observable(false); this.update_icon_class = 'fa fa-gear'; this.delete_icon_class = 'fa fa-eject'; if (genericType != ) { this.generic_type = genericType; this.modal_title = ko.observable('Uppdatera ' + genericnametype); this.update_button_text = ko.observable('Uppdatera ' + genericnametype); this.deleteAllowed(true); } };  Am I binding this.generic_type wrong?

Resolved! It took a month but I finally wrapped my head around this. Gajotres and Kevin B were instrumental in getting me to understand the underlying script use issues but each of my script problems ended up having different additional problems:  The date and time picker inconsistency below was actually due to a CSS issue with z-index. Time picker was popping and working fine script-wise but for some reason jQueryUI was setting its z-index inline to zero which put it behind the mobile page overlay. CSS override (had to do an !important) fixed that.  Had an issue with jQuery Countdown which was an ID duplicate issue since I had a PHP include pulling the same footer into each page.

Previously I had the model incorporated into the view which is a bad practice. So now I have the model being generated inside of a controller. I am using Lodash as a utility library. My current design plan is to transform the JSON object into a master array that is accessible in the controller's scope. The JSON file is being served by Express. ModelService simply gets this file to make it available in the controller. $scope.arr is the master array that I want to use in the view. I also made the JSON data available for viewing at an external link since it is so large. Here it is. (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('app') .controller('ModelController' ModelController); function ModelController($scope ModelService _) { $scope.jsonData = ModelService.getAll(); $scope.getData = function() { $scope.jsonData.$promise.then(function(data) { $scope.all = data; $scope.arr = []; _.mapValues($scope.all.parent1.clusters function(cluster) { $scope.arr.push(cluster.name); _.mapValues(cluster.subclusters function(subcluster) { $scope.arr.push(subcluster.name); _.mapValues(subcluster.entities function(entity) { \/\/ map entities }) }); }); }); }; $scope.getData(); } })();  This code is just adding cluster and subcluster names to the array. I'd like the subclusters to be mapped to their parent cluster. The idea I have for doing this involves transforming each cluster element into its own array and then adding the subclusters and then transforming each subcluster into an array in order to map the entities to them. This seems tedious and inefficient. So I am looking for a better way to achieve this.  It would be nice if I could add each cluster object to the array in one fell swoop without all the mapping and converting objects to arrays. Is that possible at all? The wireframe view looks like this. The Flex Cluster Title is the name of the subcluster and each number inside of them is an entity."}

Below is the code in parts: On button click event calling execute on UpdateGalleryview that extends AsyncTask refresh.setOnClickListener(new Button.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(View v) { UpdateGalleryview updateGalleryview=new UpdateGalleryview(); updateGalleryview.execute(GalleryView.this); } });  Then in onPreExecute() method of UpdateGalleryview class I am creating a ProgressDialog and updating the array that is sent to the Adapter of GalleryView. private class UpdateGalleryview extends AsyncTask<Context Integer String> { @Override protected void onPreExecute() { final ProgressDialog dialog = ProgressDialog.show(GalleryView.this Refresh  Loading... please wait  true); new Thread(new Runnable(){ public void run(){ \/\/Updating the Uri[] that is sent to the Adapter for GalleryView File[] imagelist; File images = new File( \/sdcard\/thumbs\/ ); imagelist = images.listFiles(); mFiles = new String[imagelist.length]; for(int i= 0 ; i< imagelist.length; i++){ mFiles[i] = imagelist[i].getAbsolutePath(); } mUrls = new Uri[mFiles.length]; for(int i=0; i < mFiles.length; i++){ mUrls[i] = Uri.parse(mFiles[i]); } dialog.dismiss(); } }).start(); Log.i( TAG onPreExecute() ); super.onPreExecute(); }  Then in onPostExecute() of AsyncTask I am calling another thread that runs on UI @Override protected void onPostExecute( String result ) { runOnUiThread(updateAdapter); \/\/ gaAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); \/\/ ga.setAdapter(gaAdapter); \/\/ ga.invalidate(); \/\/ ga.setSelection(midposition); super.onPostExecute(result); }  As you can see above I even tried to update the Adapter (gaAdapter) with new items and the GalleryView (ga) within onPostExecute() itself. But that didn't work. So I created the new thread to do it as below. private Runnable updateAdapter = new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { \/\/ TODO Auto-generated method stub gaAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); ga.setAdapter(gaAdapter); \/\/ ga.invalidate(); ga.setSelection(midposition); } };  This is my Adapter code public class ImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter { private Context ctx; int imageBackground; public ImageAdapter(Context c) { ctx = c; TypedArray ta = obtainStyledAttributes(R.styleable.Gallery1); imageBackground = ta.getResourceId(R.styleable.Gallery1_android_galleryItemBackground 1); ta.recycle(); } @Override public int getCount() { return imagelist.length; } @Override public Object getItem(int arg0) { return arg0; } @Override public long getItemId(int arg0) { return arg0; } @Override public View getView(int arg0 View arg1 ViewGroup arg2) { ImageView iv = new ImageView(ctx); iv.setImageURI(mUrls[arg0]); iv.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_INSIDE); iv.setLayoutParams(new Gallery.LayoutParams(180144)); iv.setBackgroundResource(imageBackground); return iv; } }  This is where I am at. GalleryView does not refresh automatically by doing the above."}

To see the problem fallow 4 steps:  Click first checkbox and accept date  Do the same for the second checkbox  Uncheck both (date field is empty in both rows) Check again one checkbox and accept date  You will notice now that the date was added into both fields of each row even if didn't click the second one.

{"id":"30720272","labels":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"],"tags":"ios","text":"I'm trying to make UICollectionView work like UITableView (I want the extra flexibility of collection view instead of just going with table view both for some current and possible future feature extensions); having a fixed width (screen width) and dynamic cell height (just like iOS 8's new table view feature). I've been struggling a lot to get it working. First I've enabled automatic sizing by setting an estimated size on layout on my collection view subclass: UICollectionViewFlowLayout *layout = (UICollectionViewFlowLayout*)self.collectionViewLayout; layout.estimatedItemSize = CGSizeMake(SCREEN_WIDTH 100);  Then I've set up my constraints of my custom cell in Interface Builder to let it grow according to my text view's content. I've also set up a width constraint equal to screen width programatically otherwise my cells were having a default width of 50pt. Inside my custom cell's awakeFromNib: [self addConstraint: [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:self attribute:NSLayoutAttributeWidth relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:nil attribute:NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute multiplier:1 constant:SCREEN_WIDTH]];  It seems to work for width. When I run my app it breaks height constraints as my own constraints conflict with UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height which is set to 100 (this actually means that auto-height is not really working well). I lower the priority from my vertical constraints especially the one with textview (which grows depending on its content) from required (1000) to some lower number (900). I'm not getting broken constraints anymore but that's because we don't need to break constraints anymore as UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height takes precedence. Result is exactly the same. Here is what I'm getting:  There is no problem with the GIF above. It really does jump at one point exactly as seen on the GIF. How can I prevent this behavior and make my collection view cells grow in height dynamically (of course without creating a dummy offscreen cell to calculate view sizes)? I don't need to support iOS 7 so iOS 8-and-above-only solutions are welcome. UPDATE: If I implement preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes: method as seen on the answer to UICollectionView Self Sizing Cells with Auto Layout: -(UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes *)preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes:(UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes *)layoutAttributes{ UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes *attrs = [layoutAttributes copy]; CGRect frame = attrs.frame; self.frame = frame; [self setNeedsLayout]; [self layoutIfNeeded]; float desiredHeight = [self.contentView systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:UILayoutFittingCompressedSize].height; frame.size.height = desiredHeight; attrs.frame = frame; return attrs; }  Then it's always returning the NIB's original view size that was in the Interface Builder even though I've set: self.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO; self.contentView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;  I have no idea why it's returning an incorrect value."}

The loop is running in an async task method so that it does not hang up the device and the database is handled via a database adapter.  The loop code is as follows :  while (!exportrec.isAfterLast()) { if ( exportrec.moveToNext() ) { fulldate = exportnumberformatter(exportrec.getInt(daye)) + \/ +exportnumberformatter(exportrec.getInt(monthe))+ \/ +String.valueOf(exportrec.getInt(yeare)); fulltime = exportnumberformatter(exportrec.getInt(houre))+ : +exportnumberformatter(exportrec.getInt(mine))+ : +exportnumberformatter(exportrec.getInt(sece)); noiseid = exportrec.getInt(typee); exportedinfo += exporttypes[id] +  +exportrec.getString(notee)+  + fulldate+  +fulltime+ \\n ; } }  The exportnumberformatter does the following :  public String exportnumberformatter(int i) { String result = Integer.toString(i); if (result.length() >1 ) { return Integer.toString(i); } String zeroprefix = ; zeroprefix = 0 +result; return zeroprefix ; }  The cursor is called as follows before the loop to get the data : exportrec = MD.GetAllLogs(2 date_sort ); exportrec.moveToFirst();  The MD is the database adapter and the GetAllLogs Method (this has been played with to try and speed things up and so the date_sort that is used is really ignored here): public Cursor GetAllLogs(Integer iString sortfield) { String sorted = ; if (i == 1 ) { sorted = DESC ; } else if (i == 2) { sorted = ASC ; } return mDB.query(DB_TABLE new String[] {COL_ID COL_TYPECOL_IMAGE COL_INFOCOL_IMAGECOL_HOURCOL_SECCOL_MINCOL_DAYCOL_MONCOL_YEARCOL_SORT_DATE} null null null null COL_ID+ +sorted); }  When I created the table in the database it had no indexes so I created these via the upgrade method. However they did not error or appear to fail when I did this but what I do not know is A) does the database\/table need rebuilding after an index is created and B) how to tell if they have been created ? the two indexes were based on the ID as the first and a field that holds the year month day hour minute second all in on Long Integer.

In fact some language features like iteration seem to be build on exceptions being thrown. This makes sense when considering that the (python) interpreter has to guarantee its own integrity and thus does several checks anyway. Does it make sense to expect cheap exceptions to be normal in interpreted languages? Edit:  To make clear that this question doesn't address primarily performance I should add that I try to expand my programming skills by learning new languages. I'd probably never use exceptions in non-exceptional circumstances in C++ or Pascal but in python I obviously should (and this is maybe not the only language). And because it makes a structural difference for my code if I use or not use exceptions a simple guideline\/rule of thumb would help to get started in a new language.."}

First the very basic HTML: <body> <p id= message ><\/p> <p id= movies ><\/p> <p id= object ><\/p> <\/body>  Then the JS: \/\/ Define variables var output = document.getElementById( message ); var BR = <br> ; var makeBreakfast; var mood; var energyLevel; var doWork; var powerOn; var command; var duration; var quitWork; \/\/ Define robot object var robot = { material: titanium  mood: happy  energyLevel: 100 powerOn: false command: Sweeping the floor  duration: 10 favoriteMovies: [ 2001: A Space Odyssey  The Terminator  I Robot  WALL-E  Short Circuit  Forbidden Planet ] }; makeBreakfast = function (newMood) { mood = newMood; if (mood === Happy ) { output.innerHTML += Here are your waffles and milk master. + BR; } else { output.innerHTML += Here is your burnt toast and lukewarm water master. + BR; energyLevel = 50; } }; doWork = function () { if (!powerOn) { powerOn = true; output.innerHtml += My current task is: + command + . Duration: + duration + minutes. + BR; } }; quitWork = function () { if (powerOn) { energyLevel = 90; powerOn = false; command = Taking a nap ; } }; \/\/ Make robot do housework doWork(); quitWork();  The full assignment is as follows: 1) Correct the code and make doWork and quitWork execute properly. 2) Call the makeBreakfast argument and use the string mad as the argument. 3) Add a new method and call it to display a string (left this part out not helpful right now) 4) List all of the robots favorite movies each on a new line. 5) Use named indexing syntax to add a new property called language to the robot object. Initialize it with the language of your choice. 6) Using named indexing syntax loop through the object and list each of the property and value pairs on a new line. Display the results in a new paragraph. I really only wanted help with #1 but if seeing the full assignment helps this is it. Thanks everyone!"}

It works fine if I don't define a font against the textview but as soon as I set the font to be anything above size 13 then the text disappears completely (though still scrollable). The other thing is that if I slowly type in text manually to reach the cross over point the last line is split in two and continuing to type just produces blank text. Its as if the text view can only contain so much visible text and as soon as that is reached the text becomes blank. Any suggestions welcome. EDIT: Actually copying and pasting the above answer text into the text view and then adding one more line is enough to make it start to turn invisible. Then when reloading the text view with the updated text (i.e answer above plus one line) its all invisible. Setting the font size is enough to break it just by doing systemFontOfSize: to 14. The actual font size which causes it varies depending on the amount of text in the text view. Also using ARC."}

I'm trying to display a list of members in a UITableView. Above this list I have some kind of dropdown-menu for a group selection. So if I change the group selected in the dropdown-menu I want to change the content of the UITableView underneath it. It's actually not working correctly. The first time I load the ViewController that contains the UITableView it shows the correct list of members in the default group. Now when I change the group it should display my new list of members but it doesn't. It seems that the UITableView would not even reload its table content. Here is my code for the TableViewController: MemberTableViewController.m - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; self.members = [NSMutableArray new]; self.selectedRows = [NSMutableArray new]; self.groupManager = [GroupManager new]; int *number; if (nil != [self gruppeId]) { number = [[self gruppeId] intValue]; \/\/ Here will be the id of the new selected group } else { number = 4010292; \/\/ This is just for testing.

The MemberListViewController implements a protocol of the GroupSelectionTableViewController. Its delegate function will be called when the selected group changes. Here is the code for the MemberListViewController: MemberListViewController.h @interface MemberListViewController : UIViewController <GroupSelectionDelegate> @property (weak nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *groupSelection; @property (nonatomic strong) GroupSelectionTableViewController *groupTableView; - (IBAction)groupSelectionPressed:(id)sender; @end  MemberListViewController.m - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; [self setGroupTableView:[GroupSelectionTableViewController new]]; [[self groupTableView] setDelegate:self]; } - (IBAction)gruppeAuswahlPressed:(id)sender { if ([self groupListShown]) { [[[self groupTableView] view] removeFromSuperview]; [self setGroupListShown:NO]; } else { [self.view addSubview:[[self groupTableView] view]]; [self setGroupListShown:YES]; } } - (void) groupSelectionController:(GroupSelectionTableViewController *)groupSelection DidSelectGroupWithId:(NSString *) groupId { [[self groupSelection] setTitle:name forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [[[self groupTableView] view] removeFromSuperview]; [self setGroupListShown:NO]; MemberTableViewController *memberTableView = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@ memberTable ]; [memberTableView setGroupId:[NSNumber numberWithInt:4017411]]; \/\/ Id for testing [memberTableView refreshControl];  } Now if I change the group selection the -groupSelectionController:DidSelectGroupWithId: Method is called and with [memberTableView refreshControl] I'm able to get into the viewDidLoad Method of the MemberTableViewController again and set the groupId to my testing id. Now i want the TableView to reload its content to get the members of the selected group. With the statement [self.tableView reloadData] I'm getting into the tableView:NumberOfRowsInSection: Method but not into the tableView:CellForRowAtIndexPath: Method and the TableView Content is not redrawn. What am I doing wrong ? This problem is driving me nuts so I hope there's someone to help me out. Thanks"}

The program provides some unique features that I have yet to find elsewhere and... I'm curious and intrigued by reverse-engineering the program. If you're just gonna try and help me find another program... don't bother. The Problem I'm using IDA Pro w\/ Hex-Rays Decompiler to get some half-way decent pseudocode to try and speed up the reverse-engineering. One big thing that I think will help speed up things is to figure out what strings mean. So far this is what I'm finding for strings that are more than 4 characters longer: dword_131894E = 54264588; dword_131894A = 51381002; dword_1318946 = 51380998; dword_1318942 = 52429571; dword_131893E = 52298503; runtimeVersion[0] = 836; szIndex = 0; do { runtimeVersion[szIndex] = (runtimeVersion[szIndex] - 1) ^ (szIndex + 882) ^ 0x47; ++szIndex; } while ( szIndex < 11 );  From looking at similar pseudocode for strings that are three characters and using the Hex-Rays hover overs for type information here's how I'm understanding this:  runtimeVersion is a const wchar this means it has Unicode characters (UTF-16) the string is embedded in memory but in this case weakly encrypted (XOR?)  The above pseudocode is the same for all the big strings except the constant 882 is different for every string. I'm assuming this is some sort compile-time encryption or macro that finds strings one by one and encrypts them uniquely. The problem is though that I can't seem to get a proper looking string by replicating the pseudocode. Here's what I have in C#: ushort[] newCharArray = new ushort[rawCharacters.Length]; \/\/ Go through and decode all of the characters. ushort i = 0; do { newCharArray[i] = (ushort)((i + 882) ^ (rawCharacters[i] - 1) ^ 0x47); ++i; } while (i < 11);  'rawCharacters' is a ushort array. I split each of those dword entries in half and treat each one as a ushort. I put them in the array starting from the bottom to the top... So the value assigned to runtimeVersion[0] gets added to my array first then the value from dword_131893E then dword_1318942 etc. I'm not sure what I'm missing here. This seems like it's so simple that it should be cake to reverse and recover the strings but I'm getting stumped on the conversion from the pseudocode to actual code. Thoughts?"}

I was advised to use $.ajax() but I'm having trouble figuring out how to get it working. To start off with I have a HTML file: <?php session_start(); ?> <!-- This is on the first line of the page --> ... <form id= formexample method= post action= cart.php > <select name= formexample1 > <option value= 1 >Option 1<\/option> <option value= 2 >Option 2<\/option> <\/select> <select name= formexample2 > <option value= 1 >Option 1<\/option> <option value= 2 >Option 2<\/option> <\/select> <button type= button onclick= addToCart() >Add to Cart<\/button> <\/form> <div class= test ><\/div>  I have this in a separate inlcuded PHP file: cart.php <?php session_start(); $PHPtest = 1; echo json_encode($PHPtest); \/* $_SESSION['cart'][$_POST['formexample1']] = $_POST['formexample1']; $_SESSION['cart'][$_POST['formexample1']][$_POST['formexample2']] = [$_POST['formexample2']] *\/ ?>  My goal is to access the $_SESSION variable in my Javascript but for the moment I'm trying to do get it to work with $PHPtest first. In the Javascript I have this: function addToCart() { var test; $.ajax( { url: cart.php  type: post  data: data success:function(PHPtest) { test = $.parseJSON(PHPtest); console.log(test); \/\/sends the response to your console } error:function() { console.log( Error ); } }); alert(test); }  To see how I got to this point see the thread from yesterday (linked at the top of the page) and the discussion under Josh S's answer. I'm trying to get $.ajax() to work but without success. I've been looking at online examples and have been trying to write the same format but nothing I try seems to work. Thanks in advance. EDIT: This is what I have now:  var test; $.ajax( { url: cart.php  type:'post' data: 'test' datatype: 'json' success:function(PHPtest) { test = $.parseJSON(PHPtest); alert(test); console.log(test); \/\/sends the response to your console } error:function() { console.log( Error ); } });  EDIT 2 I finally figured out how to send $PHPtest to Javascript. I wrote: $.get( cart.php  function( PHPtest ) { test = PHPtest; alert(test); });  My PHP remains: <?php \/* session_start();*\/ $PHPtest= test ; echo json_encode($PHPtest); ?>  It works for various values of PHPtest. As far as I can tell taking out json_encode between echo and $PHPtest makes no difference. EDIT 3 Here's what I have now. HTML: This is in a file bookings.php . ... Option 1 Option 2 Option 1 Option 2 Add to Cart  Javascript: function addToCart() { var test; get( cart.php  function(PHPtest) { test = PHPtest; alert(test); }); }  PHP: External PHP file cart.php : <?php \/* session_start();*\/ $PHPtest= Example ; echo json_encode($PHPtest); if(isset($_POST)) { $_SESSION['cart']['0'] = $_POST['formexample1']; } ?>  The alert shows:   Example Notice: Undefined index: formexample1 in (directory) on line 8  The same text appears in the top left of the page even if I comment out the $.get() . EDIT 4 I'm trying to extract a single PHP variable $PHPtest with AJAX. I'm also trying to retrieve POST information correctly. HTML: <?php session_start(); ?> <!-- This is on the first line of the page --> ... <form id= bookingform method= post action= cart.php > <select name= day > <option value= 1 >Option 1<\/option> <option value= 2 >Option 2<\/option> <\/select> <select name= time > <option value= 1 >Option 1<\/option> <option value= 2 >Option 2<\/option> <\/select> <button type= button onclick= addToCart() >Add to Cart<\/button> <\/form>  Javascript: function addToCart() { $( #bookingform ).submit(); var test; $.get( cart.php  function(PHPtest) { test = PHPtest; alert(test); }); }  cart.php: session_start(); $PHPtest = Test ; $PHPtest = Test2 ; echo json_encode($PHPtest); echo json_encode($PHPtest2); if(isset($_POST['day'])) { \/*$PHPtest3 = test3 $_SESSION['cart']['0'] = $_POST['day']; echo json_encode($PHPtest3); echo json_encode($_POST['day']);*\/ }  As it is the alert produces  > Test Test2  Uncommenting the isset in cart.php changes the alert to:  <br \/> <b>Parse error<\/b>: syntax error unexpected '$_SESSION' (T_VARIABLE) in <b>(directory)<\/b> on line <b>14<\/b><br \/>  Line 14 is the line with $_SESSION['cart']['0'] = $_POST['day']; ."}

At the moment the code that does this for me (and it works) is import numpy as np v = np.array([0000111222222]) e=np.array([04]) #what I want to get is the vector [0123456]. values = v[e] r = [] for i in range(n): if v[i] in values: r.append(i)  In the case when e is only one number I am able to do this: rr = np.arange(n) r = v[rr] == v[e]  which is both nicer and quicker than a for loop.

This is the code (actually part of a bigger picture but it demonstrates the issue): #include boost\/spirit\/include\/qi.hpp #include boost\/proto\/deep_copy.hpp #include boost\/optional.hpp #include <string> using boost::spirit::qi::char_; using boost::spirit::qi::lexeme; using boost::proto::deep_copy; auto string_literal = deep_copy( lexeme[ \/\/ char_(' ') \/* >> *\/ *((char_ - ' ' - '\\\\') | (char_('\\\\') >> char_)) \/\/ >> char_(' ') ]); template <class Iterator class Grammar> boost::optional<std::string> parse_string(Iterator first Iterator last Grammar&& gr) { using boost::spirit::qi::space; using boost::spirit::qi::phrase_parse; std::string temp; bool success = phrase_parse( first last gr space temp ); if (first == last && success) return temp; else return boost::none; } int main() { std::string str; std::cout << string_literal: ; getline(std::cin str); auto presult = parse_string(str.begin() str.end() string_literal); if (presult) { std::cout << parsed: << *presult; } else std::cout << failure\\n ; return 0; }  Uncommenting the commented parts of string_literal's definition causes errors. In its current state (with comments) the code compiles. I've tried several things such as moving the quotes into parse_string as well as using a less specific definition (the one above is the least specific I could come up with that was still useful the correct grammar is in the OCaml language manual but I figured I can just validate escape sequences separately) but nothing worked. My Boost version is 1.56.0 and my compiler is MinGW-w64 g++ 4.9.1. Any help at all most appreciated."}

Here's what i am actually trying to do: Application running in background ( it sends periodically network packets to office server packets are loaded with statistics data and pushed onto the server via Winsock2 and custom made protocol ).  What 'background' means here - is an application that creates a window of 00 size and is minimized - i am thinking about going into the services with this but the next thing that i require stops me today from doing this. I need this application to be 'visible' somewhere as an icon - i already know i can't do this in the 'tray' area as stated in this post: Windows Mobile C++ Tray Icon Now i was trying to utilize the: SHNotificationAdd - but this is ok for a 'notification' as the name says type of thing. So it popsup and you can click to hide it - this is bad. What i need to achieve is an icon that is visible during the application run cycle so it flashes when there is no synchronization possible it changes the icon when synchronization is done. I am a bit worried it can't be done - i even tried to go and code the Home plug-in for this purpose but was told that some people have themes installed and it might be that my application won't be even visible to those guys. Now as we're going to deploy it to few places around ( 3 data centers spread across the country - around 130 people smart phones only ) - i need to be sure this application is visible even when there is a theme applied or customization done.  Any chance this can be done ? I was kinda sure it can be done with a classic 'tray icon approach' until i found that 'tray icons' are not supported for normal applications. If there is something i can do - i would really appreciate if somebody could shed a bit of light on this for us all please."}

Let's assume we have SomeClass with something like this: void SomeClass::foo() { strand_.dispatch(boost::bind(&SomeClass::bar this)); }  Further the strand has an io_service with multiple threads calling run().  In the documentation on strand::dispatch() I read it guarantees that handlers posted or dispatched through the strand will not execute concurrently and if this is met the handler may execute in this function. What decides if the handler gets to be executed immediately? In this case with multiple threads will dispatch block if multiple io_service threads call SomeClass::foo concurrently? I.e. block for all but the one that gets executed. If so is the handlers executed in order (the order they called dispatch())?"}

Memory isn't an issue at the scale I'm interested in but being scalable wouldn't be a bad thing. Specifically the problem I'm solving is finding the size of the max clique in a graph. To distribute the program I take an N order graph and break it into N subgraphs each subgraph being the neighborhood of a unique node. The size of the max clique of each of these subgraphs is found and the maximum of these plus the one is returned as the max clique of the entire graph. The nodes of each graph (the total graph and the subgraphs) are represented as an array of integers. The same is true of edges. So technically all I need to communicate between nodes is an array of ints. The return result would be an int the size of the max clique found. From what I've read MPI is focused on problems needing distributed memory. This seems to be unnecessary for my problem. The problem is minutes long at 200MB of memory (w\/ 16 threads on 16 cores) so at 4GB (the max of most of my compute nodes) it would be computationally infeasible even with all the nodes I have. So my question is: What it a good way to accomplish this? If I'm wrong about MPI please feel free to correct me."}

Networking: If the peripheral is connected to a network (wireless and\/or ethernet) then the communication over BTLE could instead happen over the network. Model-View-ViewModel architecture RxSwift  About the App: It starts with a Bluetooth Setup view which walks the user through the process of pairing with the peripheral device (disjoint from the TabBarController). After successfully pairing with the device all configuration is requested by the iOS App from the device which is sent as JSON. This JSON contains the different Model information (programming) that the App displays to the user for manipulation and needs to be stored in a array somehow in a Singleton manor to where a view-model can request any index for displaying to the user. After all the data is received the Bluetooth View dismisses and the TabBarView's are presented.  Current Examples: A good example to relate this App to would be the Apple Watch and the correlating iOS App that allows you to configure everything. I am having to do somewhat the same concept. Another good example app from this blog post where they are doing something similar to what I am trying to achieve. The difference I am running into though is their dependency injection setup for MVVM (as well as other similar examples). I've used a storyboard where as they have programmatically instantiated their view controllers in the AppDelegate. And my problem... How can I pass the data (efficiently) from BluetoothView to TabBarView without NSNotifications or PrepareForSegues? Keeping in mind that I am intending to use the library RxSwift for asynchronous event handling and event\/data streams. I am trying to keep this App as stateless as possible. Are the Servers in this blog post a good practice for retrieving view-models and\/or updating them?"}

The DB has very simple tables data-table and folders-table and data-folders-linker. Like the good old sqlite table. I want to sync it to iCLoud in UIDocuments where i'd store the folders metadata within the single uidocument. For each entry in data-table a new uidocument would be created in iCloud. A new device upon getting the new uidocument would parse its data into the sqlite-store. thats about it. Obviously Its not perfect nor is it remotely advisable. BUT I NEED CLOUD! Already I see problems.  How would a know a new UIDocument has arrived. How would I know that this UIDocument was deleted. Since I should not persist all UIDocuments into a tableView i'll have that parsed into SQLite store. But I'd have to monitor alot of complex notifications and figure out what happened to the document and make changes to the sqlite-store.

Currently I have the following code: @using (Ajax.BeginForm(null null new AjaxOptions { OnSuccess = isFormSuccessful('AddDomainNameForm''#ajaxModal'data)  UpdateTargetId = ajaxTarget }))  This produces no errors and the function does get called but it does not get called at the proper time. It is being called before the response has been redrawn in the target div. When I investigate this issue there are many articles which say that this is caused when one passes parameters in the function within the OnSuccessCallback. Those same articles suggest doing something like this: OnSuccess = function(){exampleFunction(' + param1 + ');}  When I try that however jQuery 1.9.1 throws the following error:   Function must have a name.  I'm wondering if this is a problem with the newer jQuery. The parameters I am passing are necessary because hey are not found in the data posted back from the server. Any help on achieving this is greatly appreciated!"}
